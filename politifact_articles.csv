"Will President Donald Trump’s tariffs cost families $4,000, as Chuck Schumer says?",Louis Jacobson,"May 5, 2025","President Donald Trump’s broad array of tariffs on foreign goods hasspookedconsumers, businesses and the stock market. But what will the specific impact be for typical American consumers?
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., offered a figure April 27 on CNN’s ""State of the Union.""
Schumer said as a candidate, Trump never fully explained to voters that tariffs would raise their costs. ""It's estimated it'll raise the American costs. … American families would have to pay about $4,000 more a year,"" Schumer said.
Calculating how typical households would be hit involves estimation and assumptions — especially given Trump’s frequent tinkering with what items will be tariffed and when. But Schumer’s figure is roughly in line with four independent estimates that PolitiFact identified.
Four of five estimates by groups with varying political ideologies range from $3,100 to $4,900 a year; the midpoint of that range is in line with Schumer’s figure. A fifth group estimated the cost to consumers would be $1,243.
The estimates’ variations stem from the group’s differing assumptions about how the tariffs will be absorbed into the economy.
Schumer’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.
We identified five estimates on Trump’s tariffs effect on American families, based on the tariffs he imposed before April 2 (including those on Canada and Mexico), the 10% across-the-board tariffs on virtually every country, and the 145% tariff on China. The estimates do not include the impact of higher country-by-country tariffs that Trump announced April 2 but paused for 90 days beginning on April 9.
Here are the estimates in descending order.
Yale Budget Lab.Themost recent estimatefrom the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University shows an average loss per household of $4,900. The lab also offered a more limited calculation that accounts for changes in consumer behavior because of tariffs without factoring those in as losses; this worked out to a $2,600 loss per family.
The analysis found that low-earning families would be hit hardest: A family earning roughly $30,000 to $40,000, would lose 5.1% of its income, more than twice the proportional hit for a family earning well above $100,000.

Center for American Progress.The Center for American Progress, a liberal group,estimatedan average loss of $4,600 annually.
American Action Forum.The American Action Forum, a center-right think tank, told PolitiFact that its pre-April 9 estimate of $3,900 loss per household remains a solid guess even though it was calculated using a 60% tariff on China, rather than the current 145%. Jacob Jensen, the group’s trade policy analyst, said tariffs as high as 145% curb consumer purchases so much that they tend to bring in less revenue than tariffs that are set with lower rates.
Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.The nonpartisan Tax Policy Centerestimatedthat the average household loss would be $3,100.
Tax Foundation.The center-right Tax Foundation put the average loss lower than the other four: $1,243.
Erica York, the Tax Foundation’s vice president of federal tax policy, told PolitiFact that her group’s analysis has a more limited scope, encompassing households’ 2025 direct losses of income from higher taxes.
York said other groups’ estimates go beyond this, including loss in quality of life from having to switch to inferior products, factoring in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy response or using 2026 — assuming that it produces a full year of impact — rather than 2025, when the tariffs will be in force for less than a full year.
Differing methods such as these would produce variations in numbers, she said, citing the Yale Budget lab’s dual estimates as an example.
Schumer said ""it's estimated"" that Trump’s tariffs will mean ""American families would have to pay about $4,000 more a year.""
Calculating tariffs’ impact requires guesswork, and is complicated by Trump’s frequent pauses on certain tariffs.
Four independent groups’ estimates range from $3,100 a year to $4,900 a year on average. The fifth, using a more restrictive method, estimated a $1,243 loss.

"Trump-era fentanyl seizures have not saved up to 258 million lives, as Pam Bondi said. Here's why.",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"May 1, 2025","President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office fell on the same day as National Fentanyl Awareness Day. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi marked the milestone by crediting Trump with saving a third of the U.S. population from fatal fentanyl overdoses.
Fentanyl isa potent synthetic opioidthat causes themajority of opioid overdosesin the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine. Its potency is what makes it so lethal.
""Today is Fentanyl Awareness Day. In President Trump’s first 100 days we’ve seized over 22 million fentanyl laced pills, saving over 119 Million lives,"" Bondi said April 29 onX. That’s about one-third of theU.S. population.
Bondi shared a clip from Fox News that included 2025 Drug Enforcement Administration fentanyl seizure data. As of April 28, the agency hadseized22.2 million fentanyl pills and 3,100 pounds of powdered fentanyl in 2025. The seizures ""represent over 119 million deadly doses,"" the DEA website says, calculating 2 milligrams of fentanyl as a ""potentially deadly dose.""
At an April 30 Cabinet meeting, Bondi made a similar statement with larger numbers, crediting Trump with saving 75% of the U.S. population from fentanyl overdoses.
""Since you have been in office President Trump, your DOJ agencies have seized more than 22 million fentanyl pills, 3,400 kilos of fentanyl, since your last hundred days,"" Bondisaid. ""Which saved —  are you ready for this, media? — 258 million lives.""
It’s unclear how Bondi reached those figures about fentanyl seized or lives saved. The 3,100 pounds the DEA said it seized equates to 1,400 kilograms. The Department of Justice did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. A department spokesperson toldSlatethat the 258 million estimate included FBI fentanyl seizures.
Drug policy experts say Bondi’s statements are an exaggeration premised on a distorted understanding of seizure data.
""Bondi’s statements demonstrate profound ignorance about fentanyl and interdiction,"" Dr. Ryan Marino, a Case Western Reserve University toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction, said.
Bondi failed to account for the limitations in fentanyl seizure data, the caveats about fentanyl’s lethality and the fact that not everyone has the same chance of dying of a fentanyl overdose.
Also, Bondi’s statement assumes everyone in the U.S. planned to consume fentanyl.
""119 million Americans do not even use fentanyl, and to risk an overdose requires intentional ingestion of fentanyl (or another illicit drug contaminated with fentanyl),"" Marino said. ""Fentanyl overdose is not a risk for people who do not use drugs, as you cannot experience an overdose from touch, inhalation, or proximity to fentanyl.""
CDC data shows that about 11% of people age 12 and older use illegal drugs.
Andrew Stolbach, a toxicologist and emergency doctor at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, toldPolitiFactin 2023 that using fentanyl seizure data to make broad characterizations about how many people could have died or been saved ""assume that all that drug was somehow going to get into everybody.""
There’s likely enough water to drown everybody in the world. But that doesn’t mean everyone is going to drown, he said.

Containers of fentanyl pills are displayed at a Drug Enforcement Administration research laboratory, April 29, 2025, in Northern Virginia. (AP)
Bondi’s numbers don’t make mathematical or logical sense.
Her X statement that seizing 22 million pills saved 119 million lives assumes that one pill would be shared by five people — and each of those people then die of an overdose. Drug experts say that’s unlikely.
""It does not make sense to say that seizing one pill saved five lives,"" Jonathan Caulkins, a Carnegie Mellon University drug policy researcher, said. ""Usually a pill is only consumed by one person. It would be an odd situation for a single pill to kill five people.""
Additionally, not every pill consumption leads to death. The DEAsaysthat as little as 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be deadly for an adult. However, a dose’s lethality can vary based on a person's height, weight and tolerance from past exposure, drug experts say. The 2 milligrams lethal dose generally refers to people who have not previously consumed fentanyl.
""Usually when a pill is consumed, no one dies,"" Caulkins said. ""There are high-frequency users consuming multiple pills per day for multiple years before they succumb, if ever, to an overdose.""
Also the 2 milligrams refers to pure fentanyl. It’s generallyunclearhow much pure fentanyl is in the pills or pounds of powdered fentanyl that are seized, Marino said. Therefore, that the DEA seized 119 million lethal doses does not mean the Trump administration saved 119 million people.
Politicians have framed drug seizure data in positive or negative terms depending on their political aim.
For example, the Homeland Security Department said in an April 28press releasethat U.S. Customs and Border Protection had seized 64,000 pounds of fentanyl during former President Joe Biden’s administration. ""Enough fentanyl to kill 14 billion people.""
However, using Bondi’s logic, DHS could have also said that Biden saved 14 billion lives, double the world’s population. Either way, the fact-check caveats we already discussed apply.
Some politicians cite rises in drug seizures as a sign ofimproved interdiction. Others say those same numbers are evidence thatmore drugsare getting into the country. But drug experts say it’s hard to tell who’s right given insufficient data.
""We don’t have any method I’m aware of for translating drug seizure data into any measure of overdose deaths averted,"" Alene Kennedy-Hendricks, a Johns Hopkins University health policy expert, said.
To know how much fentanyl is in the U.S., experts said we need to know how much fentanyl is being produced, how much is being sent to the U.S. and how much is seized. We only have data on how much fentanyl is seized.
That’s part of what makes Bondi’s statement wrong. That the DEA seized 22 million pills does not mean that it reduced 22 million people’s consumption of fentanyl pills, Caulkins said.
""When drugs are seized, the supply chain partially replaces those lost drugs,"" Caulkins said.
David Luckey, a senior international and defense researcher at Rand Corp., a global policy think tank, said that the lack of data about illicit fentanyl leads to statements that are ""estimates at best, and a misuse of the data at worse.""

Fentanylseizureshave generally risen over the past decade. But they dropped in fiscal year 2024 to less than 22,000 pounds at U.S. borders compared with 27,000 in fiscal 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures show. Fiscal years start in October and end in September.
In the first two full months of the Trump administration, fentanyl seizures dropped compared to the last full month of Biden’s administration. In December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 1,200 pounds of fentanyl at U.S. borders. That dropped to 611 pounds and 760 pounds in February and March, respectively.
Fentanyl overdose deaths also started dropping during the Biden administration. The CDCreported50,000 fentanyl overdose deaths from December 2023 to November 2024, the latest available data. That’s a drop from more than 75,000 in the previous similar period.
It’sunclearwhether the drop in overdose deaths will last and for how long.
Drug expertssaythat to reduce fentanyl overdose deaths, the focus can’t be only on drug seizures. Reducing the demand for fentanyl and expanding access to treatments, such as the opioid overdose reversal drug Narcan, also play a role.
Bondi said ""in President Trump’s first 100 days we’ve seized over 22 million fentanyl laced pills, saving over 119 Million lives."" A day later, she upped the number of saved lives to 258 million.
Neither figure is accurate.
The DEA said it has seized 119 million deadly fentanyl doses in 2025. Crediting that seizure with saving up to 75% of the U.S. population makes no mathematical sense.
Bondi’s calculation rests on the assumption that 2 milligrams of fentanyl is lethal. However, lethality varies based on a person’s height, weight and tolerance to the drug. It also assumes that all fentanyl seized is pure fentanyl, which is generally not the case.
Additionally, the number of people who die from opioid overdoses each year is in the tens of thousands. Drug experts say 119 million people in the U.S. do not consume fentanyl or illicit drugs that may be laced with fentanyl; people who do not consume illicit drugs are not at risk of dying of an overdose.

President Donald Trump says Kilmar Abrego Garcia has “‘MS-13’ on his knuckles.” Pants on Fire!,Louis Jacobson,"April 30, 2025","President Donald Trump repeatedly clashed with ABC News’ Terry Moran about whether Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia — whom the U.S. government deported to El Salvador in March despite an order not to deport him there — had MS13, representing the MS-13 gang, tattooed on his knuckles.
During the ABC News interview that aired April 29, Trump referred to an image heshared on Truth Socialon April 18 showing what he said was Abrego Garcia’s tattoos.
The image shows a left hand with four tattoos, one on each finger — a marijuana leaf, a smiley face with the letter X for eyes, a cross and a skull.
The hand also displays an M, an S, a 1 and a 3 in a printed font above these tattoos. The words describing the pictorial tattoos also appear below each one in a small, printed typeface.
Trump told Moran that Abrego Garcia’s hand says MS13, which Moran said was disputed and that some had said the tattoos were ""interpreted that way."" Trump said, ""Don't do that — M, S, one, three — it says M, S, one, three."" Moran countered, ""That was Photoshopped.""
Moran tried to move on, but Trump continued. ""Terry, do you want me to show you the picture?"" Trump said. ""He had ‘M,’ ‘S’ as clear as you can be. Not ‘interpreted.’""
After Moran again tried to shift to a question about Ukraine, Trump said that Abrego Garcia has ""got ‘MS-13’ on his knuckles.""
Trump’s ABC News interview goes far beyond the impression he left when heshared an image on Truth Socialof what he said were Abrego Garcia’s finger tattoos. Trump insisted in the ABC News interview that ""MS-13"" appears on Abrego Garcia’s hand as a clear sign of gang affiliation, which was part of the evidence used to deport him.
When we asked the White House for comment, a spokesperson said that any law enforcement or immigration official with on-the-ground experience could link Abrego Garcia’s tattoos to theMS-13 gang.
The figures M, S, 1 and 3 and the words below the symbols don’t appear in other recent photographs of Abrego Garcia’s hand, including one that Salvadoran government officials took when Abrego Garcia met with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., on April 17. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukelesharedit on X.

The tattoos also do not appear in afamily photoof Abrego Garcia shared by immigration advocates.
MS-13 experts told PolitiFact thatnone of the pictorial tattoos in the photographis a known signifier of MS-13.
The Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia on March 15 to CECOT, a Salvadoranmega-prisonwhere Trump has sent hundreds of Salvadoran and Venezuelan men who were previously in the U.S. But Abrego Garcia had a protection order that was supposed to prevent him from being deported to El Salvador. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lawyersacknowledgedthat they were aware of the restriction and in court filings called his removal an ""oversight"" and ""an administrative error.""
The Trump administration has said that Abrego Garcia and others deported to El Salvador wereMS-13 gang members, which Abrego Garcia and attorneys have denied in court filings. All of the men were deported without due process; the government didn’t present evidence of their gang membership before a judge in the deportation case and the migrants weren’t given the opportunity to defend themselves. The New York Timesreportedmost of the 238 men deported to El Salvador have neither criminal records in the U.S. nor documented links to a Venezuelan prison gang.
When Abrego Garcia was arrested in March 2019, a police informant told police he was an MS-13 member, according to a report known as a ""gang field interview sheet."" A judge initially ruled in 2019 that government evidence about Abrego Garcia’s gang membership was ""trustworthy,"" and was upheld on appeal; later, two federal judges ruled that the government’s information was unsupported. It was based on clothing Abrego Garcia wore at the time of his 2019 arrest and information from what a since-fired police officer called a confidential source.
Abrego Garcia’s attorneys say the MS-13 gang membership accusation was fabricated.
Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have sought to reverse his deportation, but the government has argued that since he left U.S. jurisdiction, it cannot take action. The U.S. Supreme Courtruledthat the government must ""facilitate"" Abrego Garcia’s release. (Abrego Garcia has since been moved to a lower-security prison, according tonews reports.)
As for the pictorial tattoos on Abrego Garcia’s hand, marijuana leaves, crosses and skulls are widely used by people who do not belong to gangs. Gang crime experts said they did not stand out to them as MS-13 markers.
""I don’t believe a ‘dangerous individual’ would have such anodyne and farcically generic tattoos on his hand,"" said Liliana Castañeda Rossmann, a California State University San Marcos emerita professor of communication and author of the book ""Transcending Gangs: Latinas Story Their Experience.""
Sean Kennedy, a former federal public defender in California and now a Loyola Law School professor, said that in his experience representing and interacting with current and former MS-13 members, ""The tattoos in the photo don't look familiar to me.""
Such designs are out of character with typical MS-13 tattoos, Kennedy said.
""Within MS-13 culture, such markings would likely be frowned upon and even viewed as a sign of cowardice, as they could be interpreted as an attempt to hide or downplay gang affiliation,"" Kennedy said. ""That type of concealment goes against the gang's norms, which often demand bold, visible demonstrations of identity and loyalty.""
Charles Katz, director of Arizona State University’s Center for Violence Prevention and Community Safety, concurred.
While Katz said that local law enforcement would be more familiar with specific tattoo designs in a given region, ""I have worked on issues related to MS-13 for the past 15 years in El Salvador and the U.S. and I have never seen tattoos or graffiti suggesting that these particular tattoos are associated with MS-13.""
Experts said tattoos can be helpful in identifying gang members, as long as they are one of multiple pieces of evidence.
""While police gang experts often use so-called gang tattoos as circumstantial evidence of alleged gang involvement, in my experience, they never use tattoos alone as definitive evidence of gang affiliation,"" said David M. Kennedy, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor who studies gangs. ""This is particularly true where, as here, the tattoos are ambiguous and may reflect things other than gang ties, such as religion, loss, personal transformation or cultural identity.""
Trump said Abrego Garcia ""had ‘MS-13’ on his knuckles tattooed. … He had ‘MS’ as clear as you can be. Not 'interpreted.’""
The figures M, S, 1 and 3 and the words below the symbols don’t appear in other photographs of Abrego Garcia’s hand, including one shared by the Salvadoran government.
Experts in MS-13 and other gangs say the pictorial tattoos shown are not typical designs for MS-13 or other gangs, and they say that several of those tattoos are commonly used by people unaffiliated with gangs.

Claim about Trump rejecting Helene relief for North Carolina lacks context,Paul Specht,"April 24, 2025","A widely-shared social media post lacks important context about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s recent decision about disaster relief in North Carolina.
President Donald Trump ""just denied North Carolina’s request for FEMA relief from Hurricane Helene, calling it ‘unwarranted,’"" liberal pundit Brian Tyler Cohen said in an April 12X post.
The post — which reached 6.6 million X accounts, according to the company’s metrics — could give people the impression that North Carolina has been left to deal with Helene relief on its own.
That’s not the case. In a follow-upX post, Cohen linked to anews articlethat provided more context. Cohen didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Helene hit North Carolina on Sept. 27 and is the most devastating storm in state history, killing more than 100 people and causing an estimated $60 billion in damage, according to state officials.
FEMA initially agreed to pay for 100% of debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 180 days, or until March 27. A week prior to that expiration date, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat who was elected to the office in November, wrote a letter to Trump asking him to extend the agreement.
""This extension is critical to make Western North Carolina whole and is in alignment with executive actions from previous storms like Hurricane Maria in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, Hurricane Ike in Texas, and Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and Mississippi,"" Stein wrote.
In an April 11response, a top FEMA administrator informed Stein that his request had been denied, saying 100% federal coverage was ""not warranted."" The letter didn’t explain its decision. In a statement to PolitiFact NC, FEMA’s press office said that the agency normally covers 75% of the cost — but will continue paying for 90% of debris removal.
""FEMA initially provided a 100% federal cost share to incentivize speedy debris removal operations and recovery,"" FEMA said in an April 16 statement. ""The typical assistance FEMA provides through its Public Assistance Program is 75%, due to the severity of the disaster with Hurricane Helene, FEMA is providing North Carolina 90% far exceeding the normal 75%.""
After receiving FEMA’s letter, Stein issued a statement saying he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision and would ""urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.""
Stein’s office told PolitiFact NC that the difference in covering 90% of the costs and 100% of the costs is an estimated $200 million. That’s money that could be used on other Helene-related projects, or saved as legislators strive toslash state spending. North Carolina budget analysts say the state could face abudget deficitnext year due to declining revenues from tax cuts.
Cohen claimed on X that Trump ""denied North Carolina’s request for FEMA relief from Hurricane Helene.""
The vague post could give people the inaccurate impression that Trump is withholding all relief from North Carolina. That’s not the case.
FEMA, which operates under the Trump administration, denied a request to cover 100% of North Carolina’s costs for debris removal and other emergency protective measures — but will continue covering 90% of costs as those efforts continue.
Cohen’s claim is partially accurate — a request for relief was rejected — but leaves out the important detail that FEMA is still funding 90% of relief. We rate it Half True.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/apr/24/brian-tyler-cohen/claim-about-trump-rejecting-helene-relief-for-nort/
"Is gas $1.98 a gallon in a few U.S. states, as Donald Trump said? That’s False",Louis Jacobson,"April 24, 2025","Twice in recent days, President Donald Trump has touted the lows he says gas prices have reached during his presidency.
""You have gasoline that hit $1.98 yesterday in a couple of states,"" TrumpsaidApril 17 while meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
He repeated that statistic in another White House event April 22.
""I see that we had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon,"" Trumpsaid. ""Nobody thought they'd see that for years maybe. And that's a big thing. And we opened up our wells, we opened up our drilling.""
But no state has had an average gasoline price close to $1.98 per gallon in recent weeks. The lowest per-gallon price we could find of all U.S. gas stations was $2.11 at onestation, as of April 23, according to a company that tracks prices at stations across the U.S.
Energy experts also expressed doubt that Trump’s pro-drilling policies have affected the recent price of gasoline.
The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.
The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline the week of Trump’s most recent remark was either $3.14, according to the federalEnergy Information Administration, or $3.17, according to the industry groupAmerican Automobile Association.
Texashad the lowest statewide price cited by the Energy Information Administration, at $2.66 per gallon, andMississippi hadthe lowest statewide price in the American Automobile Association data set, at $2.68.
Both of those prices are one-third higher than the amount Trump cited.
The last timeTexashad a statewide price under $1.98 per gallon was in January 2021, when the coronavirus pandemic lowered gasoline demand because of decreased travel and commuting. The last time before that was in April 2016.
Checking GasBuddy.com, which tracks gas prices at individual stations across the country, we found no station in the U.S. offering gasoline at $1.98 per gallon.
Initially, we found one station in GasBuddy’s database that was listed as selling gasoline for 1.99 a gallon, the Sam’s Club in Mooresville, North Carolina. But when we called the location, they said this appears to be a prank report; their actual price is $2.69.
The national average price of gasoline has fallen in recent weeks, according to the Energy Information Administration. After peaking at $3.24 per gallon the week of April 7, the average price fell for two consecutive weeks, to $3.14 the week of April 21.
Trump said ""we opened up our wells, we opened our drilling."" Energy experts said the gasoline price drops do not appear to be connected to Trump energy policies; instead, they are related to increased international oil production and economic forces.
The standard source for trackingoil rig usage— from Baker Hughes, an energy technology company — shows that the number of rigs in use has been largely flat in recent months.
There’s no sign of increased U.S. oil production.
""North Dakota tends to report numbers quickly, and there'sno evidence of an uptick in production there,"" said Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
InTexasandNew Mexico, two other significant oil-producing states, oil production declined in February, said Hugh Daigle, an associate petroleum and geosystems engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
Williams-Derry attributes the recent gasoline price declines to two factors.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, which does not include the U.S., has announced that it isincreasingproduction. Boosting production means increasing supply, which, all other things being equal, usually lowers prices.
The second factor has to do with ""economic jitters related to trade and political uncertainties,"" Williams-Derry said. Trump’s tariffs ""have reduced projected economic growth, both in the U.S. and globally, which hasreducedprojected growth in global oil demand. ""
Increased U.S. oil production would not be guaranteed to lower gasoline prices, because the oil would flow into the global market supply and potentially be canceled out by other countries’ production declines.
""Realistically, there is little that can be done on the policy side to make a large difference in gasoline prices, as they are subject to global supply and demand forces,"" Daigle said.
Trump said, ""We had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon.""
The lowest statewide price during the week Trump made this remark was $2.66.
April 23 data from GasBuddy.com shows that no gas station out of roughly 150,000 nationally sold gasoline for $1.98 per gallon.
While Trump said his policies are responsible for lowering gasoline prices nationally, there is no evidence of a significant uptick in drilling or production. Analysts credit a gasoline price drop during the past two weeks to a production increase by other countries, and concerns about Trump’s policies hurting the U.S. global and economic outlook.

"Firearm-related deaths are No. 1 killer of college-age people, data shows",Loreben Tuquero,"April 22, 2025","After a gunman at Florida State University killed two people and wounded at least six others, an advocacy group posted about firearm-related deaths.
""Gun violence is the leading killer of college-aged people in the U.S.,"" Moms Demand Action, part of gun violence prevention organization Everytown for Gun Safety,posted April 17 on Threads. ""Our young people deserve better.""
According to health experts and the most recent data, the statement is accurate for firearm-related deaths in this class of young people.
Everytown for Gun Safety released a2023 reportciting 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing firearms are the No. 1 mechanism of death for people ages 18 to 25. Everytown for Gun Safety spokesperson Katie Wertheimer also pointed to a2022 articlepublished in the journal Pediatrics that found ""firearms are the leading cause of death in children and youth 0 to 24 years of age in the United States.""
PolitiFact queried the CDC’sWeb-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting Systemfor data on the most recent injury deaths for ages 18 to 25. In 2023, firearms were the mechanism that accounted for the most deaths in that age group, at 8,086. For ages 24 and 25, drug poisoning was the top cause.
CDC data showed accidents, followed by suicide and homicide, were the leading causes of death among people ages 18 to 25. These categories all include firearm-related deaths. Brian Tsai, a CDC spokesperson, told PolitiFact that although the agency does not rank firearm deaths as a leading cause of death because they occur across categories, ""our data does show that firearms are the leading mechanism of injury mortality.""
""Categories for ranking cause of death must be mutually exclusive and it has been CDC's longstanding policy to rank the homicide, suicide and unintentional injury categories,"" Tsai said in an email. ""CDC does not classify firearms as a cause of death, but rather as a mechanism by which death occurs (same is true for motor vehicle accidents).""
The CDC considers unintentionalfirearm injuriesas ""fatal or nonfatal firearm injuries that happen while someone is cleaning or playing with a firearm or other incidents of an accidental firing without evidence of intentional harm.""
In 2023, CDC data showed unintentional injuries (14,238) were the leading cause of death among people ages 18 to 25, followed by suicide (5,632) and homicide (5,060). Narrowing down to deaths by firearm, the majority were homicides (4,651), followed by suicides (3,158).
Gun-rights advocatesquestionwhether the term ""gun violence"" should include suicides. Countries such asCanadaandAustraliainclude firearm suicidein that term.Surveys about gun violenceuse varying language and criteria on including suicides.
Daniel Webster, distinguished scholar for the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, told PolitiFact the Moms Demand Action statement is accurate.
Veronica Pear, a University of California Davis School of Medicine social epidemiologist and assistant professor, also said the statistic is accurate, based on 2023 mortality data, noting that ""gun violence"" includes suicide and homicide.
Wertheimer referred PolitiFact to a2024 articleby KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, that said firearm-related deaths among ages 18 to 25 ""are predominantly due to homicides.""
Shootings on school and college grounds appear to make up a small portion of firearm-related deaths among people ages 18 to 25. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, there have been463 deaths from gunfire on school groundssince 2013. An average of 4,300 children and teens, up to age 19, were shot and killed per year from 2019 to 2023, Everytown for Gun Safety reported.
Moms Demand Action said ""gun violence is the leading killer of college-aged people in the U.S.""
Accidental deaths ranked No. 1 for people ages 18 to 25 in 2023, and firearms were the ""leading mechanism,"" according to the CDC.

"Putting claim about ""largest tax increase"" in context",Jill Terreri Ramos,"April 22, 2025","The largest tax increase in American history?
That’s what Rep. Michael Lawler claims would happen if Congress does not pass a budget reconciliation bill by the end of the year.
""The president is focused, as is Congress, on getting a reconciliation bill passed, that actually passes a tax bill, that is critical,""Lawler said recentlyon NewsNation. ""If we don’t pass the tax bill by the end of the year, we will have the largest tax increase in American history.""
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law during Donald Trump’s first term as president, nearly doubled the standard deduction.
In addition,the act limited the amountof state and local taxes filers can deduct to $10,000, cut the corporate tax rate, expanded the child tax credit and reduced marginal income tax rates. Some of the changes in the law are set to expire, while others, like the corporate tax rate cut, will not.
Judging the truthfulness of his claim hinges on how you define ""largest"" tax increase.
The Tax Foundation, which studies federal tax policy,estimatesthat if the expiring individual provisions are made permanent, the average tax rate for all filers would drop from 20.9% to 19.4%, while the share of filers who itemize would decrease from 33% to 13%. Meanwhile, 9% of filers would see a tax increase while 62% of filers would see a tax decrease.
Credibleestimatesof the cost of extending the tax cuts over 10 years are in the $4 trillion to$5.5 trillionrange, but can change depending on how different revenue actions affect other parts of the economy, and whether extending the cuts are considered in the context of other changes.
But what if the tax cuts expire without a replacement bill?
We reached out to Lawler’s office, and his spokesperson pointed us to ananalysisin May from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Allowing the tax cuts to expire would result in the single most significant tax increase by dollar amount in history, an estimated $4.6 trillion revenue increase over a decade, from fiscal year 2025 to 2034, including interest.
Lawler’s claim relies on looking at the cost of extending the expiring cuts as a total dollar figure over 10 years – not as a percentage of gross domestic product, which is the wayeconomists measurethe impact of tax changes across history.
So a PolitiFact ruling isn't as clear-cut as one may think.
""The single best measure for most purposes is probably the revenue effect as a percentage of GDP, because it eliminates the effects of inflation, real economic growth, and the size of total federal receipts,"" according to a report fromthe U.S. Treasury Department. ""The second-best measure is probably constant dollars, because it eliminates the effects of inflation and the size of total federal receipts.""
Clearly, the expiration of the tax cuts would result in a significant tax increase. But as an annual percentage of GDP, the expiration of the tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would not be the largest in history, experts told us.
The Tax Foundation, which tracks tax policy and supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, compiled a list of the largest tax increases in history, measuring the revenue changes as an annual percentage of GDP. It estimates that in 2026, if the income tax cuts are extended, revenue would be reduced by $342.4 billion, or 1.08% of GDP. If the tax cuts are not extended, the tax increase would be substantial, but it would not be the largest ever in history, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy.
Six tax law changes between 1941 and 1968 led to bigger tax increases as a percent of GDP, York said.
""The expiration (of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax cuts) would, however, be the largest peacetime tax increase, coming in just above the 1982 tax law that increased taxes by .98 percent of GDP,"" she said.
There are constant dollar comparisons over time that put the first year of extending the Trump cuts as more expensive than prior increases. But experts said that while those do adjust for inflation, they do not reflect changes in the size of the economy.
A Treasury Department analysis in 2006 found theRevenue Act of 1942cost $73.4 billion in 1992 constant dollars. The first-year cost of extending the Trump tax cuts, in 1992 constant dollars, is $147.8 billion.
Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, warned the Treasury report compares legislated tax increases – not the expiration of tax cuts.
The most comparable situation happened between 2012 and 2013, when a large set of George W. Bush-era tax cuts were scheduled to expire at the same time that a large set of tax extenders and temporary tax cuts enacted in the aftermath of the Great Recession were scheduled to expire. That would have resulted in a tax increase of$500 billion in a single year, in 2013 dollars, Rosenberg said. That would be $694 billion today. Congress extended some of those tax cuts in the American Taxpayer Relief Act.
""So, I don't think there is any question that the total amount of tax increases originally scheduled to take effect between 2012 and 2013 were larger than what is scheduled to occur next year,"" Rosenberg said. ""Congress ultimately voted to extend a large portion of those tax cuts to avoid actually letting that large of a tax increase occur, and I suspect this Congress will be no different.""
Lawler claimed Americans would face the largest tax increase in history if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires.
In pure dollar terms, he’s right.
But economists typically use a percentage of GDP to compare the cost of tax cuts or tax increases across time.
Seen this way, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expiration would not lead to the highest tax increase ever, as a percentage of GDP, although one credible analysis found that it would mark the largest peacetime increase in history.

The video in the post is not a real ""The Simpsons"" episode. Reverse image searches found that the video had beenpreviously repostedby accounts that labeled the video as AI-generated.

"No, Arizona election officials aren’t removing ‘50,000 noncitizens from voter rolls’",Madison Czopek,"April 18, 2025","After Arizona’s 15 counties reached a settlement in a lawsuit involving state voter rolls, a Fox News headline sparked misleading social media posts about thousands of noncitizens.
""Kinda crazy that Arizona Democrats needed a lawsuit to force them to remove 50,000 noncitizens from voter rolls,"" Rogan O’Handley, a conservative who uses the handle DC_Draino on X,wrote April 13, going on to accuse Democrats of election malfeasance.
His post included a pro-Donald Trump account’sscreen grabof an April 13Fox News headlinethat it described as""huge, monstrous, earthshaking news"": ""SCOOP: Arizona to begin removing as many as 50K noncitizens from voter rolls following lawsuit.""
The original Fox News report misinterpreted what Arizona county election officials agreed to do as part of the legal settlement. Officials agreed to ask the U.S. Homeland Security Department to help verify the citizenship of people on their voter rolls whose citizenship has not been verified. Not all of those people are noncitizens, and the settlement did not include a commitment to remove thousands of people from state voter rolls.
Arizona’sconstitutionprohibits noncitizens from voting in elections, and only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections.
Arizonalawrequiresvoters to provide proof of citizenship when they register to vote. Valid proofincludesan Arizona driver’s license, an Indian Census Number or Indian Affairs Card Number, or a legible copy of naturalization documents, birth certificate or U.S. passport.
Federal law, in contrast, requires only that a person registering to voteattestto their citizenship under penalty of perjury.
This means that people in Arizona who submit valid documentation of citizenship are ""entitled to vote in all federal, state, and local elections in which they are eligible,"" but people who only attest to citizenship are known as being ""federal only"" voters who can vote only in federal elections, according to theArizona Secretary of State.
As of April 1, Arizona has 46,017federal onlyregistered active and inactive voters. That’s about 1% of the state’s 4.46 millionregistered voters.
Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director for All Voting Is Local, a voting rights advocacy organization, said Arizona’s ""federal only"" voters registered to vote under the same federal requirements as Texas’ 18 million registered voters, for example.
In December, Votebeat Arizona, a news organization that reports on voting issues,reportedthat federal only voters largely include people ""living on Native land, on college campuses and at the state’s main homeless campus.""
""Many of these people are young people and or older snowbird people who may live in Minnesota part of the year and Arizona part of the year, but they don’t have an Arizona state driver’s license,"" Gulotta said. An Arizona driver’s license is the easiest way to establish citizenship, he said.
In September, the conservative political advocacy group America First Legal, working on behalf of  the civic action website EZAZ.org,suedall of Arizona’s 15 counties,allegingthey failed ""to take action to remove foreign citizens from their voter rolls."" The lawsuitarguedthat county election officials had ""ignored"" and ""failed to perform"" state and federal voter list maintenance requirements. It said officials didn’t use all available federal databases — including one from the Homeland Security Department — to help verify citizenship.
On April 8, the Maricopa County Recorder’s office, whichledsettlement negotiations,announcedthe parties reached an agreement. The statementsaidthe office had ""initiated communications"" with the Homeland Security Department, seeking assistance in verifying ""the citizenship status of registered voters who have not provided Documentary Proof of Citizenship.""
The parties’ April 9dismissalnotice said that the counties had ""agreed to ask DHS to begin responding to requests"" to help ""verify the citizenship of each county’s federal-only voters.""
Fox News’ storysaidthat the settlement meant county officials were starting ""the process of verifying and removing noncitizens from their voter rolls, including nearly 50,000 registrants who did not provide proof of U.S. citizenship.""
Sam Stone, Maricopa County Recorder’s Office spokesperson, toldVotebeat Arizonathat Fox News’ story was wrong.
Arizona counties did not agree to remove 50,000 noncitizens or 50,000 ineligible voters from its voter rolls. The settlement said only that counties would pursue an additional means to verify the citizenship of registered ""federal only"" voters.
As a result of the settlement, Stone said the counties were asking Homeland Security officials ""to provide an additional way for county officials to check voter citizenship,"" Votebeat Arizonareported.
In the days that followed, Fox Newschanged its story’s headlineto, ""Arizona to verify up to 50K people from voter rolls who failed to prove citizenship."" The start of the story now says the counties have started the process of ""verifying and removing voters,"" rather than ""noncitizens."" The outlet also added an editor’s note: ""This story has been updated to reflect that the AZ voters on the rolls under examination did not prove their citizenship at the time of registration.""
Fox News did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for information about what prompted the change.
Gulotta said that even cross-checking registered voters’ information with Homeland Security’s database wouldn’t necessarily determine if ""federal only"" voters are U.S. citizens. The database would only have citizenship information on people connected to the immigration system, such as green-card holders.
""If you were born on the Navajo Nation, you’re not in that database,"" Gulotta said. ""If you were born in the United States somewhere, you’re not in that database.""
With the settlement, county election officials agreed to try to verify citizenship another way, but Gulotta said assertions that 50,000 people who are not eligible to vote are being removed from voter rolls because of the lawsuit are ""absolutely untrue.""
An X post said Arizona Democrats ""needed a lawsuit to force them to remove 50,000 noncitizens from voter rolls.""
This mischaracterized what Arizona county election officials agreed to do as part of the legal settlement. Officials agreed to ask the U.S. Homeland Security Department to help verify the citizenship of people on their voter rolls whose citizenship has not been verified.
Not all of those people are noncitizens, and the settlement did not include a commitment to remove thousands of people from state voter rolls.

"Can voters use Real ID to satisfy SAVE Act voting rules, as Byron Daniels said? Not in 44 states.",Grace Abels,"April 18, 2025","Responding to concerns about a bill that would require proof of citizenship to vote, some Republicans have said an eligible voter needs only a Real ID.
But in 44 states, that’s not a solution.
TheSafeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, passed the U.S. House on April 10 by a 220-208vote. A priority of Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump, it would require in-person proof of citizenship, such as a U.S. passport or a combination of a driver's license and birth certificate, to register to vote.Republicans say the SAVE Act — which has a high 60-vote hurdle to clear in the Senate — is necessary to ensure that noncitizens don’t vote in U.S. elections. Federal laws already prohibit noncitizens from voting in federal elections, and cases of noncitizens voting areextremely rare.
Democrats denounced the bill as a threat to voting rights, criticizing the required paperwork as burdensome; abouthalf of Americansdon’t have passports, for example. Republicans accused Democrats of exaggerating the burden.
""To the people who are concerned about married women being able to register (to vote) there's this thing in the United States, every state does it now, called Real ID,"" said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., in an April 10NewsNation interview. ""As long as you have a Real ID, which virtually every American has to have today, it should be easy for you to register to vote.""
Sen.Mike Lee, R-Utah, and several socialmediausersmadesimilarstatementsabout Real IDs allowing people to travel and vote.
Real IDsarefederally compliant, state-issued driver’s licenses or identification cards that require documentation including a Social Security card and proof of citizenship or legal immigration status to obtain. Congress passed a 2005 law requiring state-issued IDs to meet federal minimum security standards following a 9/11 Commission recommendation.
A Real ID card is typically marked with ablack or gold star. About56%of American IDs were Real ID compliant in January 2024, but many people are rushing to get Real IDs before aMay 7 deadlineafter which a non-Real ID driver’s license, for example, will not be sufficient toboard domestic flights. (Some states, such as Illinois, are saying ""Real ID can wait"" because of high demand.)
However, not every Real ID meets SAVE Act requirements to prove citizenship. The SAVE Act accepts only Real IDs that indicate whether a person is a citizen, which most do not.
Further,Real IDscan be issued to noncitizens with lawful status, including permanent residence, temporary protected status, refugees, asylum applicants and people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Homeland Security Department’swebsitesays.
Five states — Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington — offer a version of Real ID that indicates whether a person is a U.S. citizen, called anenhanced driver’s license.These licenses are offered at an additional fee, so not every Real ID in those states is compliant with the SAVE Act. Homeland Security officials have been working since2008to bring the enhanced ID program to all states.
One more state,Idaho, in 2023 began offering IDs with an optional citizenship marker, although it’s unclear whether all are Real ID compliant.
Roughly14% of theU.S. populationlives in those six states. Florida, where Donalds is running for governor,does not show citizenshipon its Real ID.
PolitiFact found no evidence that the remaining states issue Real IDs that comply with the citizenship proof required by the SAVE Act.
Thirty-six statesalready have some form of voter ID law requiring identity verification at the polls, but the SAVE Act would implement hurdles in every state at an earlier step — voter registration. For most states, that is new terrain.
""There is only one state in the U.S., Arizona, that has experience with proof-of-citizenship to register to vote,"" said Lori Minnite, a Rutgers University political science professor and expert in voter fraud.
For state and local elections, Arizona acceptsstate IDsasproof of citizenshipafter comparing the driver’s license number to existing information in its Department of Transportationdatabase. The physical IDs are no different than those issued to noncitizens. It is unclear whether such an ID, only distinguishable from a noncitizen ID when referenced against internal state data, would count as ""indicating"" citizenship under the SAVE Act.
The SAVE Act’s author, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas,acknowledgedin a recent hearing on the bill that only a few states offer compliant licenses, and he hoped more would follow: ""We believe, right, that the structure is put in place now that allow — I think there’s at least five states that do have the citizenship status as part of the Real ID — encourage more states to do so, right? That would be part of the goal here.""
In2023, Ohio passed a law to offer enhanced driver's licenses, but it is notyet acceptingapplications.IowaandMontanaare considering bills to add a citizenship marker on IDs.
Neither Donalds nor Roy responded to requests for comment.
For the majority of Americans who don’t live in Idaho or one of the few states with enhanced IDs, the SAVE Act says they can prove citizenship with a valid U.S. passport; a military ID card and a military service record showing place of birth; or a government issued photo-ID that shows place of birth.Those documents, or a Real ID that indicates citizenship, are the only ones that can prove citizenship on their own under the bill. Without one of those, a person must show a driver’s license or identification along with another document showing birthplace, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate, consular report of birth abroad or final adoption decree.
All documents must be presented in person.
Any mismatch between documents and someone’s current identification cards could disrupt voter registration. Mismatches are common for people who change their namesfollowing marriage.
In the same hearing, Roy said the SAVE Act would not affect people currently registered to vote.
He added: ""If they have an intervening event or if the states want to clean the rolls, people would come forward to register to demonstrate their citizenship so we could convert our system over some reasonable time to a citizenship-based registration system.""
Jonathan Diaz, director of voting, advocacy and partnerships at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization that supports voting rights, said he believes the SAVE Act would apply to any updates to current registration or reregistration.
AsprominentDemocratswarned that thebillwouldmake voting harder formillionsof married women, SAVE Actsupporterssaid the bill addresses the needs of people with name changes by leaving it up to the states to decide what documentation would be required to resolve document discrepancies. It directs each state to ""establish a process under which an applicant can provide such additional documentation"" to establish citizenship if the person’s documents don’t include matching information.
Minnite called this language ambiguous: ""Could a married woman who does not have a passport and who changed her name use a marriage certificate to prove her citizenship? The SAVE Act is not clear.""Diaz said, ""Different states could have different standards and different degrees of proof needed, which will be really hard for voters to navigate.""
Donalds said under the SAVE Act, ""as long as you have a Real ID … it should be easy for you to register to vote."" Most Real IDs are not compliant with the citizenship proof required under the SAVE Act. PolitiFact identified just six states that offer Real IDs that show citizenship, and five of them require an additional fee for that type.
People living in the remaining 44 states would need other forms of documentation to register to vote under the SAVE Act, such as a U.S. passport, a military service ID and record, or a birth certificate with a drivers license.
Donalds’ statement has an element of truth because in a handful of states, people have access to Real IDs that would be sufficient to register to vote under the SAVE Act. But he ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the statement Mostly False.

Fact-checking Gov. Tim Walz on Americans’ savings,Claire Cranford,"April 16, 2025","As President Donald Trump’s tariffs dominated headlines, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz talked about his party’s messaging on the economy.
Many Americans have a sense of economic angst that the Trump campaign tapped into before the 2024 election, Walz told CNN’s Jake Tapper on April 6. Democrats, he argued, need to do a better job reaching those voters.""They're concerned that their economic future is so precarious it could slip out from under them,""Walz said. ""Less than half of Americans have $1,000 in savings.""
Research shows Americans do not feel financially stable, but Walz exaggerated the health of Americans’ savings accounts by giving the impression that nearly half have anemic reserves.
Walz’s team did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. We found data on the topic in an August 2024 Forbes survey, whichreportedthat the share of Americans with $1,000 or less in their savings accounts is closer to 28%.
Around one-third of Generation Z and millennials have less than $1,000 in their savings, the survey results showed. The number decreases for older generations: 27% of Generation X and 20% of baby boomers have less than $1,000 in savings. However, a little more than half of both generation groups reported having less than $5,000 saved.
Other surveys had similar findings.
The 2023 Federal Reserve Bank’s most recent consumer financesurveybased on 2022 data concluded that Americans’ median value of savings that year was $39,000, not including equities and real estate . It also found that 99% of families had at least one bank account, stock, bond or other type of financial asset as savings.
The data did not control for savings accounts specifically. But in transaction accounts — which can include savings, checking and money market accounts — the median holding amount was $8,000.A February 2025surveyby Bankrate, a consumer financial services company, found that 40% of Americans said they would use their savings in the event of a $1,000 emergency expense — but that 41% wouldn’t have enough savings to cover the cost. It also found that about 37% of people dipped into their savings in the past year. Of that 37%, more than half withdrew more than $1,000.
Although Walz’s statistic is exaggerated, surveys corroborate the notion that Americans are struggling to save.
""We are essentially a paycheck-to-paycheck nation,"" Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamricksaidin a press release. ""Fewer Americans have the equivalent of a financial safety net to cover inevitable unexpected expenses, despite low unemployment and steady growth. This is one of the consequences of elevated prices stemming from inflation.""
Forbes found that respondents cited the rising cost of living as the main reason they couldn’t save more.
Personal finance expertsrecommendsaving at least three months’ of living expenses. Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said most advisers say a person’s emergency savings balance alone should be about three to six months of usual monthly spending.
Bankrate found that41%of Americans have at least three months’ worth of expenses in savings.
Walz said, ""Less than half of Americans have $1,000 in savings.""
The percentage of Americans with $1,000 or less in savings accounts isn’t close to half. A 2024 Forbes survey found it's 28%, or closer to one quarter.
Other recent data from Bankrate and the Federal Reserve paints a rosier picture of Americans’ financial savings than Walz did, but personal finance experts say most Americans do not have enough savings.
Walz’s statement has an element of truth but his numbers are inaccurate. We rate his claim Mostly False.

Rep. Jasmine Crockett is not cashing her grandmother’s Social Security checks. That came from satire,Maria Briceño,"April 14, 2025","A viral TikTok post said U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, has been conning Social Security, without offering proof.
""Jasmine Crockett says she 'simply forgot' to inform Social Security that her grandmother died in 2012,"" an April 5 TikTokpostsaid, sharing a photo of Crockett. ""She's been collecting $2,600 a month for 13 years.""
The claim took off in English and Spanish. A listener called aSpanish radio stationin Miami on April 10 to ask the host about its veracity.
But this is a recycled claim that originated from a self-described satire website. We found no credible news reports or public statements from Crockett about this claim. Crockett’s office did not respond to our questions.
The TikTok’s story originated withAmerica’s Last Line of Defense, a Facebook page that posts satirical content. On April 4, the account shared a Facebookpostlinking to an affiliated fake news site with the headline, ""Jasmine Crockett ‘Forgot’ to Report Grandmother’s Death, Collected Social Security for 13 Years.""
""Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett is in hot water after a shocking revelation that she has allegedly been collecting $2,600 a month in Social Security payments for her late grandmother, who has been, inconveniently for her defense, dead since 2012,"" the satirical storysaid. ""When confronted, Crockett reportedly shrugged and said, ‘Oops.’""

"Critics of ‘Hands Off’ protests mislead with photos, videos they say are proof of paid protestors",Grace Abels,"April 11, 2025","Soon after hundreds of thousands of people gathered in cities across the world to protest the Trump administration’s government program cuts, critics of the effort cast doubt on its authenticity.
""Exposed: Anti-Elon protests are staged & paid — bussed-in, scripted, clocked-out,"" conservative influencer Mario Nawfal postedApril 6on X. The post refers to billionaire and White House adviser Elon Musk, who was one focus of the protests. Musk leads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is acost-cutting agency.More than1,000""Hands Off""proteststookplacein50 statesandabroad, but Nawfal’s post focused on the Washington, D.C., event: ""The anti-Elon, anti-DOGE, anti-Trump protests in D.C.? They aren’t grassroots. They are payroll-driven theater,"" the post said.
We examined Nawfal’s post and others like it and found the supposed evidence they presented that the ""Hands Off"" events were a pay-for-protest job did not hold up to scrutiny. Many posts misleadingly framed normal aspects of event organizing, such as printed signs and coordinated transportation, as signs of a paid conspiracy. Some posts mistook a viral satire video as fact, and others misidentified a paid signature gatherer for a protester.""We don’t pay protesters. We don’t ‘stage’ protests,"" said Sarah Dohl, the chief campaigns officer of Indivisible, a nonprofit which has been a focus of claims about paid protesters. ""What we do is support a nationwide network of grassroots organizers working to protect democracy.""
We found no evidence that April 5 protesters in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere were paid to protest. Nawfal did not respond to a request for comment.
Nawfal’s post included four videos,threeofwhichwerefirstshared by Laura Loomer, a conservative activist and podcaster who has promotedconspiracy theories, including that 9/11 was ""an inside job."" Some of the videos appear to show aMarch for Palestinethat was happening in Washington, D.C., the same day as the ""Hands Off"" protest. Nawfal’s post said protestors had ""pre-made signs handed out assembly-line style.""
Two of the videos showed large groups of people walking down Washington, D.C.’s 15th Street. Several protesters in the group carried signs that said, ""Socialism Beats Fascism."" Those signsmatchthe political action group Democratic Socialists of America’s signs from theApril 5 protest. That group did not respond to a request for comment.Distributing signs at protests is not abnormal and not a sign that the people carrying them are paid, saidCelina Su, a  City University of New York political science professor and expert in grassroots organizing.
""We want the grassroots to be somewhat organized,"" Su said. ""This doesn't mean that they're in group think, like drinking the Kool Aid of propaganda. This means that there's been meetings talking about what their campaign priorities and they're like, ‘Yeah, let's focus on this.’""
Nawfal’s post also said ""buses rolled in packed with hired protesters,"" and two of his other video clips focused on buses. Oneshowedpeople disembarking a bus. Anothershoweda bus’s luggage area where two handmade signs appeared to have been stored.
It’s not uncommon for people to ride buses into a big city — where parking can be both scarce and expensive — for a major event. ""Those charter buses, to me, prove that this is a widespread sentiment, not that they were paid to express this sentiment,"" Su said.Some protesters organized buses to travel into Washington, D.C., toparticipatein both the ""Hands Off"" protest and theMarch for Palestine. Local groupsset upwebsitesfor people seeking tocoordinatetheirtravelto the events, including waysparticipantscould pay for theirown tickets.
PolitiFact contacted several groups that helped organize April 5 events, including MoveOn, Indivisible and 50501, which was specifically formed to protest the second Trump administration. Each organization said it did not pay protesters to participate and was unaware of any organization that would. Similarly, the groups said they neither paid for nor organized buses to bring protesters to Washington, D.C.
The last video in Nawfal’s post featuredBronson Alford, aconservative influencerwho was filming interviews forTurning Point USA, a conservative advocacy group.
In the video, Alford said that after he left for a 30 minute break, he returned to find the crowd had dispersed. ""This place is dead… not a single protester in sight,"" he said in the video. ""And just 20 to 30 minutes ago, it was completely packed with protesters.""
He concluded the crowd’s absence meant ""they were paid and their time was gone"" or they are a ""cult, and they all left at once."" Nawfal had said in his post that ""protesters all left at once — just like a shift change.""Turning Point USA did not respond to our questions about what time Alford’s video was filmed, butthe landmarksseen in the video show he was standing near the Hirshhorn Museum, about a15-minute walkfrom where the protest was focused, around theWashington Monument.
Lastly, Nawfal linked to hisMarch 31 X postthat said one of the ""Hands Off"" event organizers, the progressive advocacy group Indivisible, had offered to pay people to protest Tesla and Musk. The post included screengrabs of Indivisible’s website with a link to an ""Event Reimbursement Form.""The screenshot was from Indivisible’scongressional recess campaign, which encourages people to organize in their communities when Congress is on break. It offers groups that register with Indivisible ""the option to apply for up to $200 in reimbursement for event-related costs,"" Dohl told PolitiFact in an email.
""Reimbursements require receipts, are submitted after the event, and only cover actual organizing expenses like venue rentals, printed flyers, posterboard, snacks, bullhorn batteries, or accessibility support like (American Sign Language) interpreters,"" Dohl said.So far in 2025, Indivisible has distributed about $7,000 in reimbursements, during the February and March recess periods, Dohl said. There were no reimbursements distributed for the April 5 marches because they happened outside the April 12 to 27 congressional recess period.Indivisible has atoolkitwith downloadable signs and provided free event boxes to 200 ""Hands Off"" protester groups; the boxes included placards, stickers and paint pens.
Su said premade signs, organized buses, reimbursements for expenses show organizers’ attempts to make political engagement more accessible.
We examined other social media posts sharing claims that protesters outside of Washington, D.C., were paid and found they were unsubstantiated.
Texas State University buses were privately hired:Severalsocial mediausers, including aTexas state representative,sharedavideotaken in a parking lot inNew Braunfels, Texas,where people boarded buses with Texas State University branding. ""Why are Texas State University buses being used to transport protesters against Trump, Elon, and DOGE? Who’s paying for them?""posted one X user. Texas State University issued astatementthat the private company that runs the university’s bus system is allowed to charter its buses. A private group chartered the buses, not the university.
Viral TikTok of ""paid protester"" is satire:Othersocialmediausersshared a TikTok video of a woman who claimed to be a paid protester. But this video was from aself-described satire account. Its creator later removed the video and posted another videoexplainingthat the first one was not real.

The video’s caption read, ""George Soros agitator admits he gets paid to protest."" But the man in the video was a paid canvasser gathering signatures for theProtect Utah Workerscampaign, not being paid to protest. In the video he is wearing a lanyard that says ""paid circulator,"" and he has a badge that shows he was working forLandslide Political LLC, a political consulting group that hires canvassers.

Several of the posts mentioned 50501 was organizing the protests, but a 50501 spokesperson told PolitiFact that neither its Los Angeles nor Washington, D.C., organizing teams had knowledge of the ads, and it received no proceeds from anything sold.
Concerns about paid protesters aren’t without merit. There are someprominent examplesof it happening, and it has a term — astroturfing — referring to fake ""grass"" roots.
However, ""most in-person protests are less likely to be astroturfing,"" Su said. ""If it's happening in unexpected places, in different sizes, if you see a diversity of folks,"" of different ages for example, those are all signs it is an authentic grassroots campaign.

"US trade deficit with China is less than $300 billion, not $1 trillion, as Donald Trump said",Louis Jacobson,"April 11, 2025","While hosting race car drivers at the White House, President Donald Trump explained his decision to pause country-by-country tariffs, while raising tariffs on goods imported from China, whichare now145%.
Trump focused on the importance of weaning the U.S. off Chinese goods.
""China was by far the biggest abuser in history,"" he said at theApril 9 event. ""Somebody had to do it. They had to stop because it was not sustainable. Last year, China made $1 trillion off trade with the United States. That’s not right.""
Trump repeated the $1 trillion figure five times over the week, describing it as both a ""surplus""forChina and alossor ""deficit"" for the U.S.
China did not make $1 trillion off trade with the United States in 2024.
The best estimate for China’s 2024 trade surplus with the U.S. is between one-quarter and one-third of that amount, depending on what metric is used.
We looked at 2024 trade data forgoods aloneand forgoods and services. Although the total value of Chinese exports to the U.S. and the U.S. trade deficit with China are both well above what they were more than 15 years ago, none of the figures come close to $1 trillion.
In 2024, the U.S. imported $439 billion in goods from China, and it exported $144 billion there. That left the U.S. with a $295 billion trade deficit for goods alone.
For the broader measure of goods and services, the U.S. imported $463 billion from China in 2024, and exported $199 billion. That’s a trade deficit of $263 billion in goods and services.
Neither the value of China’s exports to the U.S., nor the U.S. trade deficit with China, approached  $1 trillion in 2024.
Those numbers also haven’t come close to $1 trillion in previous years.
The largest value of goods imported from China in any single year was $538.5 billion, in 2018 during Trump’s first administration.
And the widest annual U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services was $377.7 billion, also in 2018.
The White House did not provide a source for the $1 trillion figure, instead sharing a statement that criticized Democrats’ response to Trump’s action on China.
Trump said in 2024, ""China made $1 trillion off trade with the United States.""
One way to look at his statement is to consider the value of Chinese exports to the U.S. In 2024. China exported $439 billion in goods to the U.S., less than half of Trump’s figure.
Another way is to consider the size of the United States’ trade deficit in goods with China. In 2024, that was $295 billion, less than one-third of what Trump said.
Adding in the U.S. trade in services to the trade in goods leaves a $263 billion deficit with China.

Donald Trump falsely calls 2020 election ‘rigged’ in memo targeting former cybersecurity leader,Maria Ramirez Uribe,"April 10, 2025","As President Donald Trump targeted one of his first-term government officials, he also repeated the long debunked falsehood that the ""2020 election was rigged and stolen.""
In an April 9memo, Trump directed his administration to strip security clearance from Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and investigate Kreb’s time at CISA.
Trump said Krebs ""weaponized"" his authority and ""censored speech.""
""Krebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines.""
Trump repeated that the election was rigged while he signed the memo in the Oval Office on April 9.
""This guy, Krebs, was saying, ‘Oh, the election was great. It was great.’ Well, it’s been proven that it was not only not great ... It was a very corrupt election. They used COVID to cheat,"" Trump said.
""Almost right from the beginning and (Krebs), he’s tried to make the case that this election was a safe election,"" Trump continued. ""I think he said this is the safest election we’ve ever had. And yet, every day you read in the papers about more and more fraud that’s discovered.""
The 2020 election was neither rigged nor stolen. Joe Bidenwon. States certified the results, Congress accepted the results and Biden was inaugurated in January 2021.
Trump’s repeated falsehoods about the 2020 election are not only about revenge and backward looking. He has used falsehoods about the election topush for changesto voting laws.
As the senior Trump administration official responsible for election security and infrastructure, Krebs and his agency affirmed multiple times the 2020 election’s safety.
""The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history,"" the Elections Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council & the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Executive Committees, said in a Nov. 12 statement. ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""
Krebs’ agency released the statement, but his name was not on it.
Five days later, on Nov. 17, 2020, Krebspostedon X citing alettersigned by 59 election security experts: ""‘In every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent.’""
That day, TrumpfiredKrebs, calling his agency’s reporting ""highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud."" We rated Trump’s statementPants on Fire!
Today, there’s more evidence to refute Trump’s statement about the election’s security.
Biden won the 2020 election afterreceiving 306 electoral votes, compared with 232 for Trump. Biden also got about 7 million more votes nationwide than Trump.
Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits contesting the 2020 election results; they lostmore than 60. The lawsuits failed for various reasons,including that the allegations lacked proof.
In 2022, a group of Republicans, including former federal judges, examined Trump’s statements of fraud and miscount. Theyconcludedthat the claims ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the (election) results.""
There werefew, isolated casesof voter fraud in 2020, including by Republicans. Those cases included people casting votes on dead relatives’ behalf and would not have changed the election’s outcome.
Trump said the 2020 election was ""rigged"" and Krebs ""baselessly"" dismissed ""election malfeasance.""
As the senior Trump administration official responsible for election security and infrastructure, Krebs and his agency affirmed the 2020 election’s security.
The 2020 election, one of the most scrutinized and litigated in history, was neither rigged nor stolen.

Fact-check: Trump said tariffs collections are ‘almost $2 billion a day.’ Trade experts are doubtful,Amy Sherman,"April 10, 2025","Before pausing country-by-country tariffs for 90 days, President Donald Trump repeatedly said tariffs were bringing in immense revenue.
At an April 8 executive order signing, Trumpsaid, ""We’re taking in almost $2 billion a day in tariffs. Two billion a day.""
He repeated the $2 billion figure during an April 8speechto the National Republican Congressional Committee. Trump did not cite a source for the figure.
The next day, as financial indicators tumbled,Trump flip-floppedon enacting many of his planned tariffs. Heannounceda 90-day pause on country-by-country tariffs, except for China, which will have a 125% rate. He also let stand a 10% universal tariff and existing levies on Canada and Mexico.
Had the U.S. already collected $2 billion a day from Trump’s existing tariffs?
The U.S. Treasury’s April 8daily statementcontradicts that: It showed $192 million in revenues for custom duties and certain excise taxes.
Customs duties are essentially tariffs, but excise duties are different. Still, the vast majority of the figure should be tariffs, said Robert Koopman, an American University lecturer and former World Trade Organization chief economist.
PolitiFact puts the onus on the speaker to provide evidence, and the Trump administration has provided none. Before and after Trump’s tariff reversal, we asked the White House for Trump’s evidence and received no response.
The tariff collections figure might approach $2 billion if the now-paused tariff rates were applied to past trade amounts. But that would assume that trade levels would remain unchanged when tariffs are in effect, which economists say is doubtful. It would also mean that Trump is counting future projected revenues as having been ""taken in"" already.
""The U.S. is not currently pulling in $2 billion per day from tariffs,"" whether before or after Trump’s pause, said Michael Stanaitis, who teaches international economics courses at American University.
RELATED:Flip flop: Trump said he wasn’t looking at pausing tariffs. Two days later, he did.
Trump could have arrived at $2 billion by using the same formula as Import Genius, a U.S.-based trade data aggregator.
William George, Import Genius’ research director, said he took the sum oftradebased on 2024 data and divided it by 366 days (since 2024 was a leap year) to get an average daily total import value. Then, Import Genius multiplied the daily import values by the tariff rates that were set to kick in to calculate the daily tariff impacts.
Adding those numbers for China, the European Union, Vietnam and Cambodia comes to about$1.8 billion a day. If including the smaller countries, it would increase that number to about $2 billion. George’s calculations assume across-the-board tariffs without industry-specific carve outs such as pharmaceuticals.  (The number rises to about$2.8 billionwhen Trump’s April 9 higher tariff rate for China is used.)
But this theoretical $2 billion result is unlikely in the real world, economists told PolitiFact. Import Genius acknowledged this; Trump has not.
""Here is the big caveat,"" George said. Those estimates are ""looking at 2024 trade numbers. But these policies are going to tremendously suppress trade. We can’t assume that while massively tariffing (U.S. trading partners), trade volumes will remain the same.""
Another caveat is that importers brought in more goods to the U.S. starting in 2024 in anticipation of tariff increases. This means importers might not continue to import at 2024 levels.
""It's trying to have your cake and eat it, too,"" George said. ""It is announcing income under the best possible scenario while looking at the past while not accepting reality that is going to be created by the policies themselves.""
It would take time to assess tariffs’ impact; some goods in transit are exempt if they arrivebefore May 27.
Independent estimates expect the number to fall well short of $2 billion a day.
The Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank,estimatedabout $800 million a day on average in customs duties based on currently applied and scheduled tariffs, as of April 10 — ""nowhere near the amount the president claimed,"" said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy.
Trump’s decision to pause the tariffs kept a 10% tariff in place on all countries, along with higher tariffs on China and existing tariffs on Mexico and Canada. But even after the pause, economists expressed skepticism about the $2 billion per day figure.
""While I suppose this might be plausible, it is improbable because it assumes that thevolumeof imports remains about the same,"" Stanaitis said in an email. ""The U.S. has not had this high of an average tariff rate in over a century, and we can expect that the volume of imports will decrease, thereby lowering revenue expectations.""
A potential U.S. or worldwide recession would ""also be a drag on both consumption of imports and thus tariff revenue,"" Stanaitis said. If tariffs continue to weaken the dollar, imports will rise in price, further suppressing imports.
Some companies that import goods halted shipments amid the whiplash of tariff news.
""I have spoken with many clients (who) are delaying shipments to the United States in the hope that this chaos will be resolved soon,"" Peter Quinter, chair of the U.S. customs and international trade law group at Gunster, Yoakley & Stewart law firm, told PolitiFact shortly before Trump announced his tariff reversal.
Trump said, ""We’re taking in almost $2 billion a day in tariffs.""
Trump provided no evidence for his statement. It’s possible he applied past trade data to project the impact of his  tariffs that have since been rescinded. But such a formula assumes that trade would remain constant in spite of higher tariff rates, and economists said that defies logic.
It will take time to know the tariffs’ impact, but he has not proven that they have already resulted in almost $2 billion a day. The responsibility is on Trump to explain how he arrived at the $2 billion a day figure and he has not done that.
We rate this statement False.

"Ag Secretary Brooke Rollins misleads on trade deficit by cherry picking data, relying on projection",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"April 9, 2025","U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins blamed former President Joe Biden for the rising agricultural trade deficit, while defending President Donald Trump’s tariffs on nearly every country.
""In the last four years, we had an agriculture export deficit that increased from zero when President Trump left to $49 billion,"" Rollins said in an April 6 CNNinterview. She was responding to host Jake Tapper’s question about uncertainty for U.S. farmers amid implementation of Trump’s tariffs.
Trump declared a 90-daypauseon most of his tariffs April 9 after backlash and stock market declines. Trumpdid notpause a 125% tariff on China.
The agriculture trade deficit, when the value of imports exceeds the value of exports, has increased for several years. But Rollins' statement misleads by cherry picking data and blaming Biden and his policies.
The most current data for agriculture exports, from fiscal year 2024 that ended in September, shows a $31.8 billion trade deficit. The $49 billion figure that Rollins cited is a projection for fiscal year 2025, which mainly spans Trump’s current administration.
And the agricultural export deficit was not zero when Trump left office; it was $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2020, Trump’s last full fiscal year during his first term.
USDA did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.
Agricultural economists said there are several reasons why the agricultural trade deficit has grown, and Trump’s tariffs during his first term is a major one.
In February, the Department of Agriculture published areportforecasting agricultural trade for fiscal year 2025, which started in October 2024. The report projected a $49 billion agricultural trade deficit, arecord high. The previous record was set in fiscal year 2024.
Fiscal year 2025 covers about four months of Biden’s administration and about eight months of Trump’s current administration. Also, USDA updates its projections periodically throughout the year, so it’s unclear what the final trade deficit will be for fiscal year 2025 and whether Trump’s current tariffs will affect it.
During Trump’s first term, his administration gave U.S. farmers$28 billion in subsidiesafter tariffs on Chinadecimated the U.S. agricultural export market. The New York Times reported March 31 that the current administration is considering whether to give emergency aid to farmers.
During her CNN interview, Rollins said USDA ""will make sure that we have the funds"" for farmer subsidies if needed.
Historically, the U.S. had an agricultural trade surplus. But in fiscal year 2019, during Trump’s first term, the U.S. recorded its first agricultural trade deficit in nearly 60 years, according to the USDA report.
Since fiscal year 2019, the U.S. has fluctuated between an agricultural trade deficit and surplus. In fiscal years 2019 and 2020, USDA recorded trade deficits of $1.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.
In the first two years of the Biden administration — fiscal years 2021 and 2022 — USDA recorded trade surpluses. In the last two years of the Biden administration, it moved into record-high trade deficits.
There are two ways to potentially reach Rollins’ number of a zero trade deficit, both misleading.
One way is to consider the fiscal year when Trump left office. Fiscal year 2021, which included the last few months of Trump’s first administration, had a trade surplus. But Biden was president during most of that year.
The other way is to look at the calendar year instead of the fiscal year. In the 2020 calendar year, Trump’s last full year in office during his first term, USDAreporteda $3.4 billion agricultural trade surplus. But Rollins’ $49 billion deficit figure aimed at Biden pointed to a fiscal year. Using a fiscal year to blame Biden for a trade deficit and a calendar year to praise Trump for a trade surplus is disingenuous.

Agricultural economists said the agricultural trade deficit has increased for several reasons, including Trump’s first term tariffs, the strength of the U.S. dollar and U.S. consumer demand for imported goods.
Tariffs on China during Trump’s first term
In 2018, Trump implemented tariffs against China. China retaliated by shifting its imports away from the U.S., producing goods domestically or trading with other countries. For example, instead ofimporting soybeansfrom the U.S., China began importing from Brazil.
That ""started the path to (agricultural) deficits,"" William Alan Reinsch, an international trade expert at Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.
The strength of the U.S. dollar
The U.S. dollar’s value has beenrisingsince the Great Recession waned in 2011. That means its exchange rate is higher against other currencies.
A strong dollar canbenefitAmericans traveling overseas, because their dollars buy more local currency. It also makes importsrelatively cheaper. But the strong dollar has also contributed to the agricultural trade deficit, Reinsch said, because U.S. exports cost more overseas.
""The strong US dollar and weakened foreign currencies are making it more difficult for countries to buy US exports,"" Betty Resnick, an agricultural economist,wrotein a February report.
U.S. consumer demand for imported goods
U.S. consumers have strong demand for coffee, year-round access to fruit and vegetables and alcohol. Those are products the U.S. imports in part because they aren’t domestically grown in large enough quantities to meet demand. Increased demand for those products in the U.S. means they have to be imported. And increased imports can affect the trade deficit.
According to the USDA projection, agricultural imports are expected to increase by $4 billion in fiscal year 2025 compared with 2024.
In response to Trump’s tariffs, China announced an 84%retaliatorytariff on U.S. goods starting April 10.
""The major effect will come if other countries retaliate against our tariffs,"" Reinsch said, before China announced retaliatory tariffs. ""Agriculture is usually a prime target when that happens, and, given the additional tariffs being placed on China, you can expect most trade with China to be effectively cut off because of their retaliation.""
Trade relation disruptions as a result of Trump’s tariffs are likely to negatively affect U.S. farmers, the International Food Policy Research Institute, a think tank working to reduce poverty and end hunger, said in areport. The group said other countries such as Brazil and Argentina will likely step in to fill the gaps to sell products the U.S. usually exports, such as soybeans, beef and corn.
""This shift is expected to reshape the global agricultural market,"" the report said.
Rollins said, ""In the last four years, we had an agriculture export deficit that increased from zero when President Trump left to $49 billion.""
The agricultural trade deficit was not zero when Trump left office. In fiscal year 2021, Trump’s last full fiscal year in office during his first term, USDA recorded a $3.7 billion trade deficit. During Trump’s first term, the U.S. recorded its first agricultural trade deficit in nearly 60 years, in part because of tariffs he imposed on China.
The most current data for agriculture exports, from fiscal year 2024 that ended in September, shows a $31.8 billion trade deficit. The $49 billion figure that Rollins cited is a projection for fiscal year 2025, which mostly spans Trump’s current administration.
Attributing changes in the agricultural trade deficit to the president alone is misleading. Some factors that affect the trade deficit are out of the president’s control, such as consumer demand.
Rollins’ statement includes an element of truth because in the last two years of the Biden administration, agriculture trade moved into record-high deficits. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"Flip flop: Trump said he wasn’t looking at pausing tariffs. Two days later, he did.",Amy Sherman,"April 9, 2025","In a reversal of the plan he defended for days, President Donald Trump delayed almost all of the country-by-country tariffs he unveiled April 2.
For two days, Trump and the White House denied that he was considering a pause of the tariff plan shaking global markets.
During an April 7 Oval Office event with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a reporterasked Trump,""Would you be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiation?""
""Well, we're not looking at that,"" Trump said. ""We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals. And in certain cases, they're going to be paying substantial tariffs. They'll be fair deals.""
On April 9 — hours after he told everyone to""BE COOL!""— Trump changed course. ""I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately,"" Trump posted onTruth Social.""Thank you for your attention to this matter!""
He made an exception for China, raising its tariff to 125%.

Tariffs are a tax on imported goods that businesses pay. Their cost is often passed on to consumers through higher prices.
The Trump administration has said that by raising revenue through tariffs, other federal taxes could be cut. But economists havesaidit’s unlikely high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans.
On the morning of April 7,X accountsamplified a significant exaggeration of a noncommittal response from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett responding to the possibility of a 90-day tariff pause. CNBC anchors repeated the unconfirmed information and later aired a correction.
Trump on April 7shared a clipof Fox News host Maria Bartiromo saying earlier that morning, ""Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening. ... President Trump is not going to bend.""
The White House held Trump’s line; its""Rapid Response 47"" X accountsaidreports that Trump was expected to issue a 90-day pause were ""fake news."" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitttold CNBCthe same thing.
During an April 8 White Housepress briefing, a reporter asked Leavitt if Trump was considering holding off on imposing some tariffs or reversing them due to negotiations with other countries.
""The president was asked and answered this yesterday,"" Leavitt said. ""He said he is not considering an extension or delay. I spoke to him before this briefing, that was not his mindset. He expects that these tariffs are going to go into effect.""
TheU.S. stock markethad tumultuous days and losses amid Trump’s announced tariffs.
Trump’s Truth Socialannouncementabout a pause for most tariffs came shortly after 1 p.m. ET on April 9. He said more than 75 countries had called federal officials to negotiate a solution and had not retaliated, except for China.
A few hours later at an event with auto racers, a reporter asked Trump to explain his thinking. Trump said: ""Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.""
Responding to another question about the pause, Trump said, ""I think in financial markets, because they change. Look how much it changed today. We went from, you know, pretty moderate today, but over the last few days, it looked pretty glum to, I guess they say it was the biggest day in financial history.""
Even after the 9.5% increase in theS&P 500market index on April 9, the metric was still down nearly 11% since its peak under Trump on Feb. 19, wiping away all gains since early September 2024, under both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden.
A reporter noted how Trump went from no pause to a pause in two days.
Trump said: ""You have to have flexibility. I could say, here’s a wall and I’m gonna go through that wall. I’m gonna go through it no matter what. Keep going and you can’t go through the wall. Sometimes you have to be able to go under the wall, around the wall, or over the wall. These guys know that better than anybody, right? You got to go around them sometimes, you’re not gonna go through them.""
Trump said he was thinking about a pause ""over the last few days"" as he was talking with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. ""I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning, just wrote it up,"" Trump said.
On April 7, a reporter asked Trump if he would be open to a pause to his country-by-country tariffs to allow for negotiation, and he replied, ""Well, we're not looking at that."" The White House said that social posts suggesting that Trump was considering a 90-day pause were ""fake news.""
But two days later Trump authorized a 90-day pause on the country-by-country tariffs. He said this decision came after several nations told the administration that they were willing to negotiate.
When asked by a reporter about the pause, Trump said people were ""jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy.""

Sen. Ruben Gallego is mostly right: American men trail women in higher education at historic levels,Claire Cranford,"April 9, 2025","Arizona Democrat Sen. Ruben Gallego said his political party needs to work harder to appeal to men, given how male votershelped propelPresident Donald Trump to his 2024 victory.
""A lot of Democrats don’t even try talking to men,"" Gallego said on the March 24 ""Raging Moderates""podcastepisode. ""We don’t talk about the fact that they have the lowest college attainment rate ever, that they are living at home with their parents, they are not having success.""
Data shows Gallego — whostood outamong 2024’s campaigning Democrats in part because he madeappealing to mena central part of his messaging — is largely accurate on male college attainment levels.
Education experts use the term ""college attainment"" to describe different things — in some cases, it refers to college completion rates; in others, it refers to any college experience. Gallego didn’t specify in the podcast what he was describing, but his spokesperson told us later he was referring to the share of male population on campus. Gallego’s overall point that men are attending postsecondary educational institutions at lower rates than womenhas beenwidelyreportedby think tanks and news outlets.
According to theNational Center for Education Statistics, four men were enrolled in postsecondary institutions for every six women in 2023, a historic low. This shift is a reversal of historical norms. The first U.S. woman to obtain a degree, Catherine Benson,graduated in 1840. Before then, higher education in the United States was reserved exclusively for men. Women have comprised more than 50% of college enrollmentsince 1979and the proportion of women in higher education has only grown.
Overall male enrollment numbers have increased since data was first collectedin 1869because of general population growth and larger numbers of degree-granting institutions. But thepercentage of degreesconferred on men hasshrunk at every degree level, per the National Center for Education Statistics.
The most recent data from 2020 graduates shows that, for women, thefour-year degree completion rateis 53.7%. For men, it’s 43.4%.
Richard Reeves, director of theAmerican Institute for Boys and Menand author of 2022’s ""Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It,"" said two main factors drive the college completion gap.
One reason is that they're less likely to enroll than women, and the other is that they are less likely than women to complete a degree within four years, he said.
The disparity is more pronounced for Black and Latino men, who are more than 10 percentage points less likely than white and Asian males toattend orcompletecollege, according to the American Council on Education.
Since 2008, male college enrollment has hovered around 8.4 million in the U.S.per academic year, while female enrollment has steadily increased. In 2022, 57% of male high school graduatesenrolledin college, compared with 66% of their female peers. That 57% is the same as in 1964.
""The gender gap in college is reflecting the gaps that have been accumulating all the way through the K-12 system, as opposed to causing them,"" Reeves said. ""It's not like girls and boys come out of high school equally prepared for college, and then something happens. The girls come out significantly ahead of the boys, especially on things like GPA.""
Fewer men think college is beneficial to their post-high school careers, and fewer men want to continue school when they are already lagging their female peers in K-12, Reeves said. Campus-specific surveys show that men increasingly report feeling alienated on college campuses, he said. ""They'll very often say that they'll find that the male students are the ones who just don't quite feel it ‘fits,’"" Reeves said.
Our ruling
Gallego said men now ""have the lowest college attainment rate ever.""
Gallego’s spokesperson told us he was referring to the share of college students who are men.
Although male enrollment raw numbers are higher today than they were in 1869 because of general population growth, National Center for Education Statistics data shows that men have fallen behind women in higher education enrollment and degree completion. National Center for Education Statistics data shows four men were enrolled in postsecondary institutions for every six women in 2023, a historic low.
Data from 2020 graduates shows that for women, the four-year degree completion rate is 53.7%, and for men, it’s 43.4%.

"Trump official didn’t confirm a tariff pause, but markets rallied amid false headlines",Madison Czopek,"April 8, 2025","Editor’s note:On April 9, President Donald Trumpannounced a 90-day delay for some tariffson all countries, except China, a reversal of his previous stance. On April 7, the White House had dismissed rumors of Trump considering a 90-day pause as ""fake news.""
White House officials never publicly mentioned a 90-day pause of President Donald Trump's tariffs on April 7, but X posts falsely saying they did contributed to a briefmulti-trillion dollarstock market rally.
Verified X accounts that cover markets attributed reports of the supposed pause to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who had appeared on Fox News that morning. The posts — the first of which was shared at 10:11 a.m. — shared a significantly exaggerated version of Hassett’s response to an interview question about a 90-day pause. That incorrect information was echoed in web headlines and cable outlets that cover the markets.
One larger X account said its post was based on a news headline from an outlet it did not identify. It’s stillunclearwhere that purported headline originated; the markets started climbing at 10:09 a.m., shortly before the first X posts shared the 90-day tariff pause claim.
The rumored tariff reliefboosted the marketafter days of dips since Trump announced across-the-board tariffs on trade partners April 2.
Here’s how the rumor spread before the Trump White House addressed it.
At about 8:30 a.m. E.T., ""Fox & Friends"" host Brian KilmeadeaskedHassett whether the administration would consider a 90-day pause on tariffs.
""Yeah, you know, I think the president is going to decide what the president’s going to decide,"" Hassett said. ""There are more than 50 countries in negotiation with the president. We’ve got the prime minister of Israel coming today. We’ve had a reach out overnight from Taiwan. But I would urge everyone — especially (Bill Ackman) — to ease off the rhetoric a little bit."" (Ackman, a billionaire who endorsed Trump,saidthe president’s policies might trigger a ""self-induced economic nuclear winter."")
The distortion of Hassett’s remarks appeared to start with the X account Hammer Capital at 10:11 a.m.
""Hassett: Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China,"" the accountpostedin all capital letters. Then, in lowercase text: ""Mother of all squeezes incoming.""
Hammer Capital had nearly 700 followers April 7, and the account’s blue check mark shows that its owner is an X Premium subscriber.
Twominuteslater, the ""Walter Bloomberg"" X account shared a red siren emoji andthe samepurported Hassett statement in all capital letters. The anonymous account, with 850,000 followers, primarily postsBloomberg Terminalheadlinesabout the markets. Although it isn’t affiliated with Bloomberg News, TechCrunchreportedit has been considered a reliable source of business news.
A 10:14 a.m.articleon ForexLive, a market news and analysis website, warned that the viral headline’s source was unclear even though the headline was being shared ""everywhere.""
Around the same time, CNBC anchors attempted to explain a sudden market rally.
""Apparently, Hassett’s been saying that Trump will consider a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except for China,""saidCNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla.
Jeremy Siegel, a frequent CNBC guest and Wharton School professor emeritus of finance, said: ""Oh, well that’s huge. I mean that changes the game.""
""We’ll try and source that exactly in terms of where that’s coming from,"" CNBC host David Faber said. A few moments later, a CNBC chyron repeated the claim circulating on X. After those initial mentions, CNBC reporters discussing the reported headline repeatedly said that the White House had not confirmed the news.
A CNBC spokesperson said later that as the network reported the market news in real-time, it had aired unconfirmed information in a graphic. Within about 20 minutes of its original report, CNBC’s senior Washington correspondent Eamon Javers made an on-air correction.
Next, Reuters ran a story crediting CNBC. The newswire later withdrew the story, according to anarchived version of the link.
""Reuters, drawing from a headline on CNBC, published a story on April 7 saying White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had said that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China,"" the storysaid. ""The White House denied the report. Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error.""
At 10:33 a.m., CNBC’s Javersreportedthat White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told him the 90-day pause chatter was ""fake news.""
By 10:38 a.m., the White House’s Rapid Response 47 X account alsodismissedclaimsof an upcoming 90-day tariff pause.

In response to journalists’ questions on X, the account Hammer Capital did not provide the source of the information in its initial X post. At almost 1 p.m., the accountsaidit had been ""regurgitating what the market was reacting to"" after ""trading desks started sending out this headline at 10:09."" PolitiFact messaged Hammer Capital on X and received no response.
The Walter Bloomberg account owner also did not respond to our email inquiry asking for the source of its post. The account owner toldThe Wall Street Journalthey first saw the headline at 10:09 a.m. Those who run the Walter Bloomberg account founda 10:12 a.m. X postfrom another stock market-focused account and, ""given the market movement,"" determined the headline must be credible and shared it, The Wall Street Journalreported.
For the media, the incident revealed reporting difficulties when facing ""a highly volatile stock market,"" said Jane Kirtley, a University of Minnesota professor of media ethics and law. She said the ""missing piece"" for news organizations was getting a response from the White House before publishing the original stories.
""The White House may not have been immediately forthcoming, but ultimately, news organizations should do everything possible to confirm a rumor — especially one with the implications this one had,"" she said.
X posts say Hassett said, ""Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China.""
The posts appear to have been amplifying a distortion of a noncommittal response Hassett gave on ""Fox & Friends"" to a question about the possibility of a 90-day tariff pause. We found no credible reports that the Trump administration was ever considering a 90-day tariff pause.

But the video is not proof of weather modification.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration shows examples of cirrostratus cloudson its website. NOAAdescribesthese clouds as ""transparent, whitish veil-like clouds with a fibrous (hair-like) or smooth appearance."" They can look similar to a ""milky veil of fog.""
Dippman said these clouds generally indicate an approaching weather system.
The user posted the video April 1, ""the only day after the storm where cloudier skies dispersed and sunny to mostly sunny skies were the prevailing skies,"" Dippman said, so it would make sense for cirrostratus clouds to have approached from the southwest given that the next system’s outer reaches were observed that afternoon, later affecting northern Michigan.
Martin Baxter, Central Michigan University meteorology professor, told PolitiFact ""there are no weather modification programs in Michigan."" He also said this video showed cirrostratus clouds ""associated with an approaching warm front on the date of the video.""

Laura Loomer’s X posts don’t prove that national security official added journalist to Signal chat,Madison Czopek,"April 4, 2025","Conservative activist Laura Loomer targeted a deputy national security adviser and questioned whether he is to blame for the Trump administration including a journalist in a Signal group text about bombing Yemen.
In the March 26X postabout the incident, when officials weretexting operational detailsabout the bombing without realizing a journalist had accidentally been added to the chat, Loomer listed seemingly unrelated details about Alex Wong, such as where his wife works and his previous employer.
""Why do we have a CHINESE Deputy National Security advisor who is married to a CHINESE US ATTORNEY who worked under Obama and Biden, and who helped prosecute (Jan. 6 defendants) after the stolen 2020 election?"" Loomer wrote.
""Given the Chinese connections, it really makes you wonder"" whether adding The Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to the text chat was ""part of a foreign opp to embarrass the Trump administration on behalf of China,"" she wrote.
Loomer’s original post and subsequent ones included no evidence of wrongdoing by Wong. But she laid the groundwork for a baseless theory that quickly spread on social media.
""Well Well Well look who it is: Alex Wong is the individual who added Jeffrey Goldberg to the Signal chat,"" read a March 27Facebook postthat included a photo of Wong. It cited Loomer and quoted her X post verbatim.
Another March 27 postechoedthe claim that Wong added Goldberg to the Signal chat, also citing Loomer.
These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

(Screenshot from Facebook)
In her X thread, Loomer repeatedly provided what she called ""receipts."" But those screenshots didn’t support the Facebook posts’ claims about Wong.
Loomer’s ""receipts"" provided as evidence for her claim included Wong’s wedding photos and details about his and his wife’s previous work for U.S. law firms and the U.S. government.
None of it is proof that Wong added Goldberg to the Signal chat. National Security Adviser Michael Waltz said publicly he was responsible for Goldberg erroneously being added to group text.
In herpost, Loomer focused on Wong’s wife, a lawyer who worked as an assistant United States attorney during the Obama and Biden administrations and the first Trump administration.
Loomer repeatedly described Wong and his wife as Chinese. We searched news stories and public records and found no examples where Alex Wong publicly identified his race or heritage.
Tagging senior FBI officials Kash Patel and Dan Bongino on X, Loomer said Wong should be removed from his position and investigated by the FBI.
In a subsequent March 26X post, Loomer wrote that when Trump was asked how Goldberg was added to the Signal chat, he said Waltz’s ""staffer"" had Goldberg’s phone number.
""That appears to be a reference to @MikeWaltz47’s Deputy National Security Advisor, Alex Wong,"" Loomersaid, including an article screenshot that said Wong was the staff member Waltz had tapped to lead the team monitoring the U.S. attacks in Yemen. ThearticleLoomer screenshotted said, ""It was not clear if Waltz himself, or a staffer managing Waltz's Signal account, sent Goldberg the invitation.""
Loomer shared Wong’s wedding photos and screenshots of articles about his wedding and screenshots that mentioned Wong’s wife’s work. One screenshot showed Wong previously worked at the law firm Covington & Burling LLP, which Trump hastargeted. In another lengthy post, Loomer focused on Wong’s work on Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.
We contacted Loomer and received no response.
The New York TimesreportedApril 3 that Loomer visited Trump at the White House, seeking to convince him to fire National Security Council employees who she said were insufficiently loyal. Six people were fired after the meeting, according to the Times, although Wong was not among them.
The Atlantic’sreports, which included screenshots of the Signal chat, show that a person with the user name ""Michael Waltz"" added Goldberg to the group chat. A National Security Council spokesperson told The Atlantic that what Goldberg was sent ""appears to be an authentic message chain.""

On ""The Ingraham Angle"" on March 25, Waltz said he didn’t text Goldberg or have his contact information. Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked, ""So you don’t know what staffer was responsible for this?""
Waltzresponded: ""Well, look, a staffer wasn’t responsible. Look. I take full responsibility. I built the group. My job is to make sure everything is coordinated.""
Throughout the interview, Waltz maintained that he created the group and erroneously added Goldberg, whom he believed was someone else, to the Signal chat. ""I take responsibility. I built the group,"" he said.
Ingraham: ""I mean, I don’t mean to be pedantic here, but how did the number get in the chat?""
Waltz: ""Have you ever had somebody’s contact that shows their name, and then you have somebody else’s number there?""
Ingraham, joking: ""Oh, I never make those mistakes.""
Waltz: ""You’ve got somebody else’s number on someone else’s contact, so of course I didn’t see this loser in the group. It looked like someone else. Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical mean is something we’re trying to figure out.
Ingraham: ""So, a staffer did not put his contact information — ""
Waltz: ""Of course not. No, no, no, of course not — ""
Ingraham: ""But how did it end up in your phone?""
Waltz: ""Well, that’s what we’re trying to figure out.""
Ingraham: ""OK. But that’s a pretty big problem — if there are numbers — ""
Waltz: ""That’s what we’ve got the best technical minds, right?""
Facebook posts said Loomer’s reporting proves that Wong ""is the individual who added Jeffrey Goldberg to the Signal chat.""
Loomer’s ""receipts"" included Wong’s wedding photos and details about Wong and his wife’s previous employment with U.S. law firms and the U.S. government. None of the information proved that Wong added Goldberg to the Signal chat.

"Trump touted a 50% drop in egg prices. Wholesales prices have plunged, but retail prices lag behind",Louis Jacobson,"April 4, 2025","As President Donald Trump promoted his tariff hikes in an April 2 Rose Garden address, he veered back to a favorite 2024 campaign topic: egg prices.
""The egg prices came down 50%,"" he said, praising Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins. ""You got them down 50% once we got involved, they were going through the sky, the egg prices, they were going through the sky, and you did a fantastic job. Now we have lots of eggs, and they're much cheaper, down about 59% now, and they're going down further.""
During theBiden administration, more than 100 million egg-laying chickens died from bird flu or were killed to stop the virus’ spread. Flock-culling is standard practice employed by presidents in both political parties for addressing bird flu. But the prevention measure under Biden led to egg shortages and higher prices.
Some social media accountsmockedtheTrump administrationfor celebrating egg prices while the stock markettanked. But the most recent data on wholesale egg prices lends some support to his numbers, even if retail prices have yet to drop. That drop is likely to happen.
""There is a lag between the retail and the wholesale price,"" said Jada Thompson, University of Arkansas associate professor of agriculture economics. ""Retailers ultimately set the final price we see as consumers. I’d expect a few weeks to fully transition the price. It takes some time to move products off the shelf that were purchased at a higher price, but as they do the prices will start coming down.""
Empty egg shelves at a Whole Foods in Bethesda, Md., on Feb. 11, 2025. (Louis Jacobson / PolitiFact)
When contacted for comment, a White House spokesperson pointed to Agriculture Department data showing the national wholesale price for a dozen large, white eggs.
OnJan. 21, Trump’s first full day in office, that price was $6.55. On March 28, it was $3. That’s a decrease of more than 50%.
Consumers aren’t necessarily experiencing this price decline at the check-out register yet.
The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ latest data showed the Februaryretail egg priceswere about $5.90 for a dozen grade A, large, up from about $4.90 in January, that’s up about 16%. That price is also higher than December’s Biden-era $4.14 and higher than the $4.82 peak price in January 2023.
The good news for consumers is that retail egg prices are likely to drop in the coming months. The Agriculture Department’s most recent March 28weekly egg markets overviewsaid because ""wholesale price changes can take up to three weeks to be reflected in the retail dairy case, consumers are only now starting to see shelf prices slowly decline.""
University of Central Arkansas economic associate professor Jeremy Horpedahl put that delay at four to five weeks.
""This isn't a hard and fast rule, and it could be delayed by increased demand as Easter approaches, and any further supply shocks from avian flu,"" Horpedahl said. ""But since wholesale prices peaked at the end of February, consumers should start seeing some declines in retail markets right now (and some areas of the country are seeing this, to some degree).""
Eggs are predominantly produced domestically. Horpedahl cautioned, though, that tariffs could have some impact on egg prices, because the U.S. has imported eggs this year to help increase supplies.
Everything in economics, including egg prices, centers on supply and demand, said North Carolina State University professor emeritus Michael Walden, who taught a class about agricultural and resource economics.
The jump in egg prices resulted from the avian flu dramatically reducing the number of laying hens. Initially, people and businesses still wanted to buy eggs, he said, but as high prices persisted, many consumers shifted to other sources of protein.
""In economics lingo, ‘demand,’meaning buying, of eggs dropped, thereby putting supply and demand more compatible and resulting in lower prices,"" Walden said. ""The ultimate ‘cure’ will be increases in the hen-laying numbers, but that will take time.""
The bottom line, Walden said, the recent egg prices drop is mainly because people were buying less.
The USDAsaidMarch 20 that it had taken steps to lower egg prices through easing restrictions and providing money to support farmers.
However, Walden said reduced demand did more to lower prices than any of the department’s actions.
David Anderson, a Texas A&M University professor of agricultural economics, told PolitiFact that the Trump administration’s steps are good moves, but they are more beneficial long term. He also said that neither Trump nor former President Joe Biden should get credit or blame.
""The whole problem here is the occurrence of bird flu,"" Anderson said. ""If that would not have happened we would not have seen this kind of increase in egg prices.""
Trump said ""the egg prices came down 50%.""
The wholesale price of eggs was $6.55 per dozen when Trump took office in January. By late March, it was $3, a decrease of more than 50%.
Retail prices have remained high — $5.90 per dozen in February, the latest data available, which was higher than they were in January and higher than their peak during Biden. Consumers may not yet be noticing these price drops at the register, however experts say they should soon.
The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

They’re soon to see everything from car prices to food go higher.""
Measures of consumer confidence have historically carried weight both on private-sector business investment decisions and policymaking by elected officials.
On April 2, after Booker’s speech, President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs that could affect future consumer confidence levels. For now, though, the latest data available is from February and March.
The two main consumer confidence surveys — the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index — support Booker’s statement. Booker’s office confirmed to PolitiFact that those surveys were what the senator referenced.
To some extent, ""way down"" is in the eye of the beholder. But compared to recent presidents at the start of their terms, the drop under Trump is unusually large.
""It's a serious fall,"" said Dean Baker, an economist and cofounder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.
The Conference Board, a business research group, has produced its Consumer Confidence Index for decades. It gauges consumers’ feelings about topics such as current and future labor market conditions, current and future business conditions and future income expectations.
In November 2024, the month Trump was reelected, the index stood at 111.7. Since then, it has fallen every month, with the March measurement at 92.9, a 17% decline since November.
The last time the index was below 92.9 was in the first month of Joe Biden’s presidency, January 2021, when it was 87.1. That was during the coronavirus pandemic, and beginning with February 2021, the metric never fell below 92.9 for the remainder of Biden’s term.
A related Conference Board metric known as the Expectations Index — which is based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions — dropped in March to its lowest level in 12 years and below the threshold of 80 that usually signals a recession ahead, the groupsaidin its news release on the monthly numbers.
How does Trump compare with his recent White House predecessors?
Since 2001, two presidents (Trump in his first term, and Biden) saw the Conference Board index rise during the same timeframe we tracked for Trump’s current term — from the November before they took office to March of their first term.
Two other presidents saw it fall: George W. Bush, by 9%, and Obama, by 30%. Obama took office in 2009 during the Great Recession, at a historic low point for the index, meaning a modest drop in points produced a large percentage decline.
TheUniversity of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which has also been tabulated for decades, rose from November to December 2024, then fell in January and February. From December 2024 to February, it declined nearly 13%. February’s level was lower than at any point in 2024.
""The decrease was unanimous across groups by age, income, and wealth,"" survey director Joanne Hsuwrotein the statistical release.
This decline was the largest among presidents since 2001.
Since 2001, three presidents (Obama, Trump in his first term and Biden) saw the University of Michigan index rise during the same timeframe we tracked for Trump’s current term — from the November before they took office to February of their first term.
The only president in that timeframe to see a decline in the index, Bush, saw a 15% reduction, which was smaller than Trump’s reduction in his current term. For Bush, this period came during the lead-up to a recession, whichofficially beganin March 2001.
Booker said, ""The consumer confidence in this country has gone way down.""
This aligns with the two major consumer confidence surveys. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index has fallen by 17% since November 2024, while the University of Michigan Consider Sentiment Index has fallen nearly 13% since December 2024.
With one exception, for Obama during the Great Recession, these declines are greater than for any president since 2001 during similar timeframes in their presidencies.

Social media post distorts ballot shortage in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election,Amy Sherman,"April 2, 2025","Just after polls closedApril 1 for the Wisconsin state Supreme Court election, a right-leaning social media account distorted information about a few polling locations running out of ballots.
""Here we go again… SEVEN counties in Wisconsin have Run out of Ballots, others are also low on Ballots. I try telling people… this is intentional,"" read an April 1X postfrom an anonymous account with the user handle, MJTruthUltra..""The entire purpose is to chip away from REAL voters. They are chipping away, little by little, the republican voter turnout.""
The post included a clip of CNN reporting that Milwaukee election officials said that multiple sites were either running low on or ran out of ballots.
We sent a message to the MJTruthUltra X account, which has nearly a half million followers and identifies itself as ""watchdog, researcher and humor specialist,"" but does not reveal the account holder’s identity. We received no response.
The X post misleads about what happened April 1.  Multiple news reports, including from theMilwaukee Journal Sentinel,PolitiFact’s Wisconsin partner, said that seven Milwaukee voting sites temporarily ran out of ballots. An elections official told PolitiFact on April 2 that upon further review, eight sites were affected.
We found no credible news reports that seven counties ran out of ballots. We also found no evidence that the Milwaukee ballot shortage was intentional; election officials said voter turnout was higher than expected.
The post’s claim that the ballot shortage was an effort to chip away at Republican voter turnout is contradicted by voter data. Milwaukee heavily leans left —about five times as many votersthere cast ballots for liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford than for conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel. It would be criminal for election officials to intentionally run out of ballots to deny people the right to vote, and we found no evidence that happened.
The ballot included a nationally-watched race in which Crawford beat Schimel55% to 45%,according to unofficial results, maintaining the court’s 4-3 liberal majority. President Donald Trump endorsed Schimel and former President Barack Obama asked voters to support Crawford. Elon Musk, a Trump adviser,paid registered votersto sign a petition rejecting ""activist judges"" and held a rally in the state a few days before the election.
Milwaukee election officials said April 1 that ""unprecedented high turnout"" resulted in seven city polling locations running out of ballots. ​​Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Paulina Gutiérrez said that anyone in line by 8 p.m. local time could vote and encouraged voters to stay in line, the Journal Sentinel reported.SeveralWisconsinoutletspublished similar reports, all about Milwaukee.
On April 2, Gutiérrez told PolitiFact that an initial review showed that eight sites experienced a period of time with no ballots and about 61 ran low. The city had about 180 voting sites.
In response to the ballot shortage, Milwaukee election officials sent more staff, equipment and ballots to those locations.
Gutiérrez said the Election Commission ordered more ballots about a week before the election because early voting was busy. But April 1’s high turnout meant the sites used the additional ballots and still needed more.
Milwaukee officials said city voter turnout was about 50% compared with about 39% in spring 2023, when the state had another Supreme Court election.
Statewide, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found that based on the number ofactive registered Wisconsin voters— about 3.8 million — voter turnout was almost 62%. But that doesn't include people who registered at the polls on April 1. Wisconsin is one ofseveral statesthat allows same-day voter registration.
""Turnout was very high, record setting, for an April court election,"" said Charles Franklin, a professor and director of the Marquette Law School Poll. He said the turnout was the ""highest ever for an April election.""
Ann Jacobs, the Wisconsin Elections Commission chair, said in an April 1X postjust before 7 p.m. Central Daylight Time, ""In line at 8 pm means you vote!"" and that Milwaukee officials were working hard to resolve the ballot shortage.
Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson Joel DeSpain told PolitiFact the morning after the election that the commission received no reports of jurisdictions other than Milwaukee running out of ballots.
Two groups that monitor elections, Common Cause Wisconsin and Keep Our Republic, told PolitiFact that they heard reports of only Milwaukee running out of ballots.
We found oneX postsaying that Lincoln, asmall communityin Wood County, ran out of ballots.
Trent Miner, Wood County clerk, told PolitiFact that Lincoln ran out of pre-printed ballots and printed more. He said turnout exceeded his predictions.
Ari Mittleman, executive director of Keep Our Republic, a group that has held voter educationevents in Wisconsin, attributed the ballot shortage to high voter interest.
""The shortage was simply a result of record turnout — far exceeding expectations — combined with the complexity of managing multiple ballot styles due to overlapping local races,"" Mittleman said. ""When high turnout meets a large number of unique ballot types, certain ballots may run out more quickly.""
Mittleman said that Milwaukee election officials acted ""swiftly and transparently"" to address the ballot shortage. ""The goal was to prevent any need to extend polling hours, and it appears that was successfully achieved.""
There were no verified reports of people being turned away or unable to vote because of a ballot shortage, Mittleman said.
An X post said, ""Seven counties in Wisconsin (ran) out of ballots"" and it was ""intentional"" to diminish Republican voter turnout.
Milwaukee elections officials said they ran out of ballots at eight municipal voting sites because of high turnout. The city sent extra ballots to those sites and said that anyone in line before 8 p.m. was eligible to vote. One voting watchdog group told PolitiFact it had seen no verified reports of voters being turned away or unable to vote.
We found no evidence that seven counties ran out of ballots, and the claim that the ballot shortage was an effort to chip away at Republican voter turnout is contradicted by voter data.
The statement includes an element of truth because the city of Milwaukee ran out of ballots at a small number of sites. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

JD Vance falsely says Maryland man deported to El Salvador was ‘a convicted MS-13 gang member’,Louis Jacobson,"April 2, 2025","Vice President JD Vance tangled with a critic on X over the status of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, an immigrant living in Maryland who was deported by the Trump administration to an El Salvador prison.
Citing an article inThe Atlantic, liberal podcaster and former speechwriter for President Barack Obama Jon Favreau accused Vance in a March 31 Xpostof ""accidentally sending an innocent father from Maryland to a torture dungeon in El Salvador.""
The following day, Vancepostedon X, ""According to the court document you apparently didn’t read he was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here. My further comment is that it’s gross to get fired up about gang members getting deported while ignoring citizens they victimize.""
My comment is that according to the court document you apparently didn’t read he was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here.My further comment is that it’s gross to get fired up about gang members getting deported while ignoring citizens they victimize.https://t.co/cPnloeyXYk
Court records and interviews with legal experts agree that Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime in the U.S.
""Public figures, especially those like Vance who hold high office, should be precise with their words,"" said David W. Leopold, an immigration attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association who is not a party to Abrego-Garcia’s case.
Vance’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.
Abrego Garcia’scasebecame national news in the context of the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation policies, including its use of an El Salvador prison as a destination for deportees it alleged were criminals or gang members.News reportshave saidthat the government used people’s tattoos and social media posts as evidence of their gang involvement.
In 2019, Abrego Garcia was granted a restriction against being deported to El Salvador because when he was a minor living in El Salvador, a gang had tried to recruit him and extort money from his mother, leading to death threats. He illegally immigrated to the United States Abrego Garcia was eligible to be deported to other countries.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lawyers acknowledged in a Marchcourt filingthat they were aware of the restriction on deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador and called his removal an ""oversight"" and ""an administrative error.""
Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have sought to reverse his deportation, but the government has argued that since he has left U.S. jurisdiction, it cannot take action. Justice Department attorneys alsosayAbrego Garcia’s attorneys have ""not clearly shown"" that he would be tortured or killed in El Salvador.
Abrego Garcia has been in immigration authorities’ radar for years.
In March 2019, he and several other men were questioned by police at a Home Depot, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have said in court filings. When the police asked for information about gang members, Abrego Garcia said he had no information, but one of the other men accused him of being in a gang.
Because of this accusation — which Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have repeatedly denied in court, saying it was fabricated — Abrego Garcia was taken into ICE custody, where judges denied bond, bothinitiallyand onappeal, citing the police informant’s accusation. When he received the protection from deportation to El Salvador, he was released from ICE custody, and he eventually worked as a sheet-metal apprentice in Maryland, got married to a U.S. citizen and had a child.
Vancecitedthe testimony from the Home Depot incident to identify Abrego Garcia as a gang member. Other White House officials have also publicly described Abrego Garcia as a gang member, including White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, whotold reportersthat it is a ""fact"" that he was ""a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang,"" without presenting evidence. Leavitt further accused Abrego Garcia of taking part in human trafficking, again presenting no evidence. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have denied the accusations.
Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, told PolitiFact that his client has ""never been convicted of any crime, gang-related or otherwise,"" and we also found no court evidence he had been convicted.
In 2019, Baltimore-based immigration judge Elizabeth Kesslerdenied Abrego Garcia’s initial bondrequest, writing that ""the determination that (Abrego Garcia) is a gang member appears to be trustworthy and is supported by other evidence in the record, namely, information contained in the Gang Field Interview Sheet,"" referring to the testimony of the people with Abrego Garcia at the Home Depot. Kessler cast doubt on law enforcement’s reliance on ""clothing as an indication of gang affiliation,"" but she found ""the fact that a ‘past, proven, and reliable source of information’ verified the Respondent’s gang membership.""
When Kessler’s ruling was appealed, it wasupheld.
""We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s danger ruling,"" the decision says. The decision rejected challenges to the reliability of the statement provided by the informant at the Home Depot, saying the judge ""appropriately considered allegations of gang affiliation"" against Abrego Garcia.
However, neither of these court proceedings constitutes a conviction, because they were not trials. A request for bond from ICE detention requires less evidence than a criminal conviction.
Abrego Garcia ""was denied bond because of allegations of gang membership, not because he was convicted of a crime,"" Leopold said. Indications of gang membership, ""even if baseless, are often used to make critical decisions about a noncitizen’s custody status,"" he said.
Rick Su, a University of North Carolina law professor who specializes in immigration law, said Vance’s use of the term ‘conviction’ isn’t valid. Su said he’s seen public officials use ""criminal-like terms, like ‘criminal alien’ … to suggest that simply violating civil immigration laws constitutes a ‘crime.’""
Sandoval-Moshenberg said that when Abrego Garcia received the order ofprotectionfrom deportation to El Salvador, ICE did not appeal the decision, and he received a work permit upon his release, which he has since renewed.
Legal experts told PolitiFact that the differences between immigration law and criminal law can be confusing. They said a person can be deported even without a criminal conviction.
Su added that ""being a ‘gang member’ is not by itself against the law."" Gang members might commit crimes, and gang membership could potentially increase the penalties if they are convicted, he said. ""This is why it was so hard to convict people in organized crime,"" Su said. ""You had to actually catch them doing a crime, not just allege they were a member.""
Vance said that Abrego Garcia ""was a convicted MS-13 gang member.""
Abrego Garcia’s attorney said his client has never been convicted of any crime. We also found no evidence that he has any convictions.
Vance appears to be referring to two denials of bond requests in which immigration courts used allegations that Abrego Garcia was in a gang as a reason for their denial. Abrego Garcia’s team denies that he’s a gang member and — he has never been put on trial for or convicted of criminal charges.

Hjørdis Joanardottir Poulsen, a Greenland Police spokesperson, pointed to aMarch 24 press releasethat, when translated to English, said Greenland Police ""requested assistance from Danish police districts"" to manage the delegation of U.S. visitors.
""For operational reasons, we are not providing details about our efforts and measures, but we can inform you that we did receive Danish officers as assistance on March 23,"" Poulsen told PolitiFact via email. ""It is completely normal procedure to request assistance from other districts when there are major events. The police always make a specific assessment of whether an event or visit gives rise to any additional police measures. This is the reason why we asked our Danish colleagues to help with the task.""
She confirmed that the video showed ""our Danish colleagues arriving on March 23.""
A Denmark Ministry of Defense spokesperson pointed us to the Danish media company DR’sMarch 23 reportthat said Danish police officers were on the way to Nuuk, Greenland, ahead of the U.S. delegation’s visit.
On March 28, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussenposted a videoin which he rebuked the Trump administration’s rhetoric.
""We are open to criticism,"" Rasmussen said. ""But let me be completely honest. We do not appreciate the tone in which it’s being delivered. This is now how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.""

Rasmussen’s video included no mention of Danish or French troop movements.
On March 29,Trump refusedfor at least thesecond timeto say the U.S. would refrain from using military action to take Greenland.
Using Google searches and the Lexis news database, we found no credible reports that Denmark or France sent troops to Greenland.
In January,Politico reportedthat the French Foreign Minister said France had ""started discussing [troop deployment] with Denmark,"" but Denmark didn’t want to proceed. We found no reports suggesting Denmark’s position changed.

"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is wrong, ‘Sesame Street’ was not replaced by ‘drag queen storytime’",Grace Abels,"April 1, 2025","Cookie Monster, Big Bird, and Elmo have had a prime PBS spot since 1969. Have they been booted?
On PBS, ""they now have drag queen storytime instead of good old Sesame Street,"" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.,during a March 25 interviewwith Newmax host Chris Salcedo. Greene made the comment before a House hearing about defunding PBS.
PBS is a nonprofit that distributes free-to-air educational, news and entertainment programming to local independent member stations across the country. About16%of PBS’ funding comes from the federal government, a PBS spokesperson told Politico.
Greene Spokesperson Nick Dyer pointed PolitiFact to the PBS defundinghearing,during which Greene referenced a 12-minute, 2021 segment of the show ""Let’s Learn."" That segment featured the drag queenLil Miss Hot Messreading her children’s book ""The Hips on the Drag Queen Go Swish, Swish, Swish."" In it, she sings and dances along to the words of her book to the tune of ""The Wheels on the Bus.""""Let’s Learn"" started in 2020 to support at-home learning with segments on reading, writing, math and social studies.
But that doesn’t mean ""drag queen storytime"" replaced ""Sesame Street.""
The 55th season of ""Sesame Street"" will air on PBS thisfall. ""Sesame Street"" episodes are also available for streaming on Max, formerly HBO, until 2027. The 55th season will be the last season streaming on Max, as ""Sesame Street"" seeks anew streaming partnerfor its 56th season.
""Sesame Street"" is created and produced by the nonprofitSesame Workshop, which distributes the show to PBS. Future funding cuts to PBS that Greene supports could affect local PBS stations, especially those in rural areas thatheavily relyon federal funding.
Although PBSdistributesprogramming to its member stations, local stations also can produce and air their own programming.
The segment Greene flagged was funded and produced byThe WNET Group, the nonprofit that operates New York City’slocal PBS station, in partnership with the New York City Department of Education. PBS hassaidit did not distribute it.
When contacted for comment, The WNET Group Spokesperson Kellie Castruita Specter did not answer whether the segment aired on the local network or only online; she said it was no longer ""in circulation."" The""Let’s Learn"" websitesays the show is ""nationally broadcast"" but it does not specify which markets air the show. Specter also said the national PBS organization doesn’t distribute ""Let’s Learn.""
At the House hearing, Rep. William Timmons, R-S.C., asked PBS CEO Paula Kerger about the segment.
""The drag queen was actually not on any of our kids shows. It did not air. It was a digital project (the New York City station) did for the Department of Education,"" Kerger said.
The segment ""was mistakenly put on our website by our New York City Station,"" Kerger said at the House hearing. ""It was not intended for national distribution. It was immediately pulled down. It was never broadcast.""
Greene at the hearing said Kerger ""lied under oath,"" pulling up screenshots of the video’s webpage which listed the video as ""aired 04/01/2021"" and ""expired 05/24/2021.""Jennifer Byrne, a PBS spokesperson, told PolitiFact via email that the use of the term ""aired"" does not mean it was broadcast, but reflects the date it was posted online.
Based on archived versions of PBS.org and screenshots of the page Dyer shared, the video wasavailableto view online for about two months. OnPBS.orgviewers can watch shows produced by PBS, such as ""PBS News Hour,"" and some shows presented bylocal stations.
Greene said that on PBS, ""they now have drag queen storytime instead of good old Sesame Street.""""Sesame Street"" continues airing on PBS and has not been replaced by drag queen storytime.Greene referenced a 2021 segment of the show ""Let’s Learn,"" produced and funded by a local New York City member station and the New York City Department of Education. PBS did not produce or distribute the segment that featured a drag queen singing along to the book, ""The Hips on the Drag Queen go Swish, Swish, Swish.""The video was available on PBS.org for about two months in 2021.

Elon Musk didn’t fund a Neuralink implant procedure for a 7-year-old named ‘Lily Thompson’,Loreben Tuquero,"April 1, 2025","A Facebook user shared a heartwarming story about billionaire businessman and Neuralink Corp. co-founder Elon Musk paying for a 7-year-old girl’s life-changing medical procedure.
The post described a child named Lily Thompson who was diagnosed with a ""rare neurological disorder that left her unable to walk, speak, or even breathe without assistance."" After Musk learned of her condition, the post said, he ""funded an experimental procedure at a top California hospital, implanting a Neuralink chip to repair damaged neural connections.""
""Lily’s family received an unexpected lifeline when Musk personally pledged to cover every penny of her care, including a pioneering surgery that could restore her chance at a normal childhood,"" theMarch 27 Facebook postread.
The post featured an image of Musk, who is an adviser to President Donald Trump, beside a child’s hospital bed as the child gazed away from the camera, a tangle of tubes and devices attached to her head and chest. It was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
(Screenshot from Facebook)
But no evidence supports this narrative. PolitiFact found no credible news reports showing Thompson is a real person who received Musk’s assistance.
Neuralink, which Musk helped launch in 2016, produces achip designedto be implanted in a human brain to help people with mobility issues control computers or mobile devices withtheir thoughts. PolitiFact contacted Neuralink but received no reply.
The image in the Facebook post appears to have been generated using artificial intelligence. Rijul Gupta, CEO of deepfake detection company Deep Media, told PolitiFact its deepfake detection system said the image ""contains evidence of generative AI,"" which means it has a high probability of being AI-generated.
""The lack of details on some of the text on the sick girl's medical equipment, and the perspective inconsistencies in the background details on the wall are evidence which support this conclusion,"" Gupta said in an email.
Musk haspreviouslypostedon X about Neuralink recipients. In January, he said there were three patients with a Neuralink implant. TheNeuralink blognamed them as ""Noland, Alex and Brad."" There was no mention of a girl named Lily Thompson. News reportsidentifiedone of the recipients as 30-year-old Noland Arbaugh; the other two recipients have not been publicly identified.
Neuralink’s clinical trialstudy overviewsaid people should be 22 to 75 to be eligible to receive the chip. Bloombergreportedthat Neuralink estimates each implant surgery costs the company about $10,500, and it charges insurers about $40,000.
""All three individuals are unable to move their arms and legs — Noland and Alex due to spinal cord injury (SCI) and Brad due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),"" read aFeb. 5 Neuralink statement. ""They each volunteered to participate in Neuralink’s PRIME Study, a clinical trial to demonstrate that the Link (the Neuralink implant) is safe and useful in the daily lives of people living with paralysis.""
Searching for the Facebook post’s caption text led us to a March 23articlepublished on News.Citestesitu.Com, which provides no information about its owner or authors. According to the article, Musk learned of Thompson on March 22; the article’s publication date suggests the surgery took place within a day, which is implausible.

Apple isn’t secretly installing Starlink into your iPhone with software updates,Maria Briceño,"March 31, 2025","The warning is out across social media: Update your iPhone and you risk automatically installing Starlink, satellite technology owned by billionaire businessman and Trump administration adviser Elon Musk.
But this message needs a fact-check.
""Do not update your iPhone to iOS 18.3,"" a woman in a March 5TikTok postwarned. ""I almost ruined my device… because bestie in case you’re unaware Apple’s new game changer iPhone update brings Starlink —Starlink — satellite access. … So if you now update your iPhone, you are going to have Starlink right in your back pocket accessing your data.""
Otherpostsraised the same alarm about what they said was the product of a partnership between Apple and the Starlink companySpaceX.
But claims that iPhone updates will automatically allow Starlink to access your data are unfounded.
TikTok identified this video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read moreabout PolitiFact’s partnership with TikTok.)
The Washington Post,GizmodoandForbeshave all tackled this rumor, and each pointed to a JanuaryBloombergarticle as one potential source of confusion on the topic.
An Apple spokesperson told PolitiFact that Apple’s only satellite partnership is withGlobalstar, which supports texting, roadside help and emergency assistance. It doesn’t partner with Starlink.
Here are the things we know about the T-Mobile and Starlink partnership.
T-Mobile and Starlink in2022 announcedthey were partnering to introduce phone technology that aims to reduce dead zone exposure in remote areas where cell phone tower signals are hard to get.
The satellite-to-mobile connectivity service, called T-Mobile Starlink, is available free now in itsbeta formto people who sign up; it will start costing money in July.
T-Mobile promoted the service in aSuper Bowl LIX adand emphasized that it was available to ""anyone on any wireless carrier"" to try it out. Although the ad showed people using the service to send videos and pictures, the beta service provides text messaging capabilities only, according to T-Mobile’swebsite.
T-Mobile also says the service can be used bymost phonescreated in the last four years, including Apple iPhone 14 and later versions.
But there’s no evidence that accessing the satellite network is automatic or triggered by an iPhone operating system update.
People mustsign upto send text messages via Starlink satellite in areas without cell service. In July, using the service will cost $15 a month for people on most plans. It will also beincludedfor no additional charge to people on T-Mobile’s Go5G Next plan. But all of these options require the smartphone owner to opt in.
If users who are part of the Go5G plan don't want to be part of T-Mobile Starlink, they canturn offcarrier-provided satellite features on their phone settings.
Satellite-smartphone connection is not new.
For example, the iPhone 14 or later models canconnectto satellites to text for emergency service help, request roadside assistance, message people and share location when there is no Wi-Fi or cellular coverage.
Apple states on itswebsitethat ""Apple satellite features (provided by third party company, Globalstar, Inc.) are included for free for two years with the activation of an iPhone 14 or later (all models). Your carrier may also provide satellite features.""
We rate the claim that updating your iPhone to iOS 18.3 automatically installs Starlink as False.

"Hillary Clinton sent emails ‘stamped’ Top Secret? No, government reviews paint a different picture",Madison Czopek,"March 28, 2025","After top U.S. national security leaderserroneouslymessageda journalistsensitive operational detailsabout impending military action, political figures on both sides of the aisle called to mind other classified documents incidents.
Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., posted a video on X, asserting that the Trump administration’s use of the commercial messaging app Signal to discuss bombing Yemen was incomparable to Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email and private email server when she was President Barack Obama’s secretary of state.
""To compare the two, between Hillary Clinton and what President (Donald) Trump’s cabinet members were doing is absolutely absurd,"" MullinsaidMarch 26. ""Hillary Clinton was sending classified documents that were stamped TS or TSSCI.""
The acronyms are intelligence shorthand for ""top secret"" and ""top secret/sensitive compartmented information.""
On the contrary, in the Signal conversation among Trump administration officials, Mullin said no classified information was shared.

Signal contained no classified information. For years, Hillary Clinton shared classified national security secrets from her personal email. Forget about apples to oranges, this is like comparing apples to a steak.pic.twitter.com/dobUV1cDnx
That Clintonemailed information marked ""TS or TSSCI"" was not borne out in any of the investigations into her emails. Although FBI and State Department reports found that some classified material was included among some Clinton emails, none of them were clearly marked as classified or top secret, as Mullin said.
As secretary of state, Clintonuseda personal email address ending in @clintonemail.com, which meant its data was housed on private servers in her New York home. The emails have been the subject of FBI and congressional scrutiny for years.
A 2019 State Department report rebuts Mullin’s statement that Clinton sent classified information. In 2016, theFBI reportedthat 113 of the approximately 30,000 emails it reviewed contained information that was classified at the time they were sent or received. Of the emails, the FBI reported that ""a very small number"" of emails containing classified information were duly marked signaling their classification.
The State Departmentreportsaid ""instances of classified information being deliberately transmitted via unclassified email"" were ""rare."" ""There was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information,"" it said.
Thomas Blanton, the director of George Washington University’s National Security Archive, said the National Security Archive team has reviewed thousands of the now-public emails from Clinton’s private server.
""None of them were stamped TS (Top Secret) or TSSCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) at the time they were sent or received,"" Blanton told PolitiFact. ""None of them were even marked as classified at the time she sent or received them.""
He added that the State Department concluded the same thing after reviewing all the emails.
We emailed Mullin’s spokesperson and received no response.
From July 2016 to September 2019, the State Department’s Office of Information Security reviewed ""tens of thousands""of documents, gathered statements from hundreds of past and current State Department employees and conducted dozens of interviews.
The State Department team concluded that Clinton’s ""use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise,"" because a private system lacked the security capabilities of State Department networks.
For the sake of speed, classified information was in some instances ""inappropriately introduced into an unclassified system,"" but the people involved were ""aware of security policies and did their best to implement them in their operations,""the reportsaid.
The State Department report also said that ""a typical security violation involves pre-marked classified information discovered"" at the time of the incident, none of which was found.
""None of the emails at issue in this review were marked as classified,""it said.
In 2016, the then-FBI Director James Comeysaidthat of the approximately 30,000 emails the agency analyzed, eight email chains — containing an unspecified number of individual emails — contained information classified ""top secret"" at the time they were sent or received. Other email chains contained information classified at levels below top secret. Comey did not specify how many emails containing classified information Clinton sent compared to how many she received.
But Comey said that emails containing classified information weren’t properly labeled.
""Only a very small number of the e-mails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information,"" hesaid, without providing the number of emails marked appropriately.
Comeytestifiedon July 7, 2016, that classified documents come with headers signaling their classification level and acknowledged that the documents in Clinton’s emails had no headers. He also said that three of the approximately 30,000 emails had classification markings.
When asked whether emails lacking headers would have told Clinton that the material wasn’t classified, Comey replied, ""That would be a reasonable inference.""
TheJustice Department’s 2018 reporton the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation said prosecutors found no evidence that Clinton or her aides intended to ""communicate classified information on unclassified systems.""
The 2018 report also said that the classified emails weren’t appropriately marked.
""The emails in question lacked proper classification markings,""it said. ""The senders often refrained from using specific classified facts or terms in emails and worded emails carefully in an attempt to ‘talk around’ classified information.""
The 2018 report said prosecutors recommended against prosecuting because ""none of the emails contained clear classification markings as required."" Three email chains included paragraphs marked ""C"" for confidential. But that’s not a complete or sufficient classification marking.
Mullin said, ""Hillary Clinton was sending classified documents that were stamped TS or TSSCI.""
Mullin provided no information supporting his statement and FBI and government reviews contradict him.
In 2016, Comey testified that three of the approximately 30,000 emails reviewed had any classification markings at all, and those markings did not signal the documents were top secret or TSSCI. A 2018 Justice Department report reiterated that the emails ""lacked proper classification markings."" And a 2019 State Department report said ""none of the emails"" reviewed ""were marked as classified.""
We rate this claim False.

Democrat wrongly says NC ‘always had nonpartisan judicial races’ until Republicans took over,Paul Specht,"March 28, 2025","A North Carolina legislator’s recent complaint about judicial elections featured an inaccurate claim about their history.
State Sen. Sydney Batch, a Wake County Democrat who is the chamber’s minority leader, recently introduced abillto make North Carolina’s judicial elections nonpartisan.
North Carolina’s judicial races are receiving extra attention this year because the November election for an open North Carolina Supreme Court seat remains uncertified. Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin is challenging the eligibility of 60,000 voters who cast ballots in his race against Democrat incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who received 734 more votes than Griffin, recounts showed.
Batch discussed her bill during a Feb. 28 appearance on aWUNC-FM podcast. In it, she accused her Republican colleagues of politicizing the court.
""In North Carolina, and in its history, we always had nonpartisan judicial races, and when the Republicans took over several years ago they changed it,"" Batch said.
Republican legislators in recent years made formerly nonpartisan judicial races partisan by requiring that candidates’ party affiliations appear next to their names on ballots. But Batch’s description of the court’s longer history is inaccurate.
North Carolina first started electing judges after the Civil War, said Michael Crowell, author of a judicial elections historyreportfor the University of North Carolina School of Government.
""It was seen as a one of many democratic reforms,"" Crowell said. ""And those were partisan elections. The idea of nonpartisan elections just didn't cross anybody's mind.""
The voting process was different during Reconstruction than it is now, said Gerry Cohen, who wrote most of the state’s election laws during his 32-year tenure in the legislature's bill drafting office. Party operatives wouldprint ballotswith the names of candidates on them, he said. Voters could simply take a ballot from a party operative and place it in the ballot box to vote.
""Back before literacy, the Democratic Party had a symbol and the Republican Party had a symbol,"" Cohen said.
North Carolina’s judicial elections were partisan throughout most of the 20th century, when Democrats controlled the state Legislature.
However, when Republicans started winning more judicial races in the 1990s, Democrats moved to make the races nonpartisan,WRAL reported.
""Republicans started getting elected to some offices in the ’70s and ’80s, but it didn't trickle down to judges until the ’90s,"" Crowell told PolitiFact NC in an interview.
Democrats didn’t publicly point to any judicial election losses as the reason for making the races nonpartisan, Crowell said. But it was understood to be a factor.
""No Democrats said in the mid ’90s, ‘Look, we need to change this, because Republicans are starting to win elections.’ But that was pretty much what was thought to be the case,"" Crowell said.
Elections in different levels of the court system became partisan in different years. Superior court races went from partisan to nonpartisan in 1998. District court elections became nonpartisan in 2002. And the Supreme Court and other appellate court races went nonpartisan in 2004.
Then, in 2011, Republicans gained control of the state Legislature for the first time in more than a century. Within a few years, they started making judicial races partisan again. Lawmakers added partisan labels to Court of Appeals candidates in 2016, and to Supreme, Superior and district courts in 2018.
The change has paid off: Voters had largely split on judicial elections when they were nonpartisan, but after Republicans made the races partisan again, they’ve won almost every statewide judicial election. The GOP now controls large majorities on the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court.
Batch’s office declined to comment for this fact check.
Crowell offered a disclaimer to those interested in North Carolina's judicial elections history: ""Keep in mind: both parties have changed their position on fundamental issues over the years about the election of judges depending on what they think benefits them in the short run.""
Batch said North Carolina ""always had nonpartisan judicial races and when the Republicans took over several years ago they changed it.""
Within the past decade, Republican legislators made judicial races partisan. But North Carolina’s longer history shows judgeship elections were partisan for most of the 20th century.

There was bad weather in Seattle those days. But there were no reports of tornadoes touching down in the city March 26 or 27, Logan Howard, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Seattle, told PolitiFact.
""We had some thunderstorms move through. On (March 26), we were forecasting for some of them to potentially be severe, but that kind of didn’t manifest,"" Howard said.
There were no reports of severe wind or hail out of those thunderstorms, just frequent lighting and heavy rain, Howard said. On March 27, there was rain, but no thunderstorms.
Mike Doll, an AccuWeather meteorologist, said tornadoes are very rare in Seattle or in Washington state.
""As far as we have seen, there were no tornadoes on the 26th and 27th,"" Doll said, adding there were no reports of wind damage despite rain and thunderstorms in that region.

Dan DePodwin, AccuWeather's senior director of forecasting operations, looked at the videos PolitiFact sent.
""The flat topography, fall foliage on the trees, and even palm trees in some of these clips make it clear that these are intentionally misleading videos that were not recorded in Seattle or anywhere near the Pacific Northwest,"" DePodwin said.
He said the videos are examples of a ""disturbing trend"" of social media users taking footage from real extreme weather events — and sometimes artificially generated videos — to create ""intentionally misleading posts.""

Fact-checking Donald Trump on whether automobile plants are ‘being built at levels we’ve never seen’,Louis Jacobson,"March 28, 2025","President Donald Trump’s plan to impose widespread tariffs on foreign goods aims to persuade foreign manufacturers to produce their goods in U.S. factories and employ Americans.
During a recent interview with the conservative network Newsmax, Trump said this effort had already produced results.
""We have automobile plants being built at levels we've never seen anything like it, and they're going up fast,"" TrumpsaidMarch 26.
When we asked White House staff for evidence, they cited recent expansion plan announcements from carmakers Hyundai, Stellantis and Honda.
However, automotive industry experts said Trump exaggerated. In most cases, these announcements represent reallocations of investments at existing facilities, not newly built plants. And they may or may not come to fruition.
It’s premature for the president to take credit for plant expansion given his short time in office, said Dimitry Anastakis, a University of Toronto business history professor and author of the 2024 book ""The North American Auto Industry since NAFTA. ""Plants are planned years in advance,"" he said.
We found no data to confirm that the spate of recent announcements amounts to a record-setting level of automotive manufacturing investment.
Three foreign-based carmakers have recently said they would invest significant sums in U.S. production.
Hyundai. In February, the Korean carmakerannouncedthat it wouldincrease its production capacityat its ""metaplant"" in Georgia from 300,000 to 500,000 vehicles per year, producing both electric vehicles and hybrids. It also announced that it would increase output by an unspecified amount at its Alabama plant, which currently produces 356,100 vehicles per year.
In March, Hyundaiannouncedat a White House event that it was initiating a roughly $21 billion investment in the U.S., including a $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana to provide material for the company’s EVs.
Hyundai Motor Co. CEO José Muñoztold Axiosthat the ""the best way"" for the company to ""navigate tariffs is to increase localization.""
Honda. In March,Reuters reported, based on unnamed sources, that the Japanese carmaker would manufacture its next-generation Civic hybrid vehicle in Indiana rather than Mexico.
Honda had initially planned to manufacture the next-generation Civic in Guanajuato, Mexico, starting in November 2027, Reuters wrote. But it now plans to build the new Civic at anexisting plantin Greensburg, Indiana, beginning in May 2028, with an expected annual production of 210,000, according to Reuters’ reporting.
Stellantis. In late January, the Dutch company that owns Chrysler, Jeep, Fiat and other car brandsannouncedthat it would invest $5 billion in the U.S., including reopening an assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois, that once produced Jeep Cherokees and had been shuttered since February 2023. The company now plans to make midsize trucks there starting in 2027.
A closer look at the three companies’ announcements highlights differences with Trump's framing.
First, they are announcements of plans set to occur several years from now, which means that the companies could modify the plans before they come to fruition.
Second, none of the moves involve ""automobile plants being built,"" as Trump put it, but ramping up production at existing plants or reopening a closed plant. Hyundai’s planned Louisiana steel plant will provide materials for EVs.
Greig Mordue, a manufacturing policy professor at McMaster University, said companies like Hyundai, Honda and Stellantis are likely preparing to accelerate already decided launches to adapt to political realities.
""They will be looking at models that will be coming to the end of their natural cycle, something that occurs at five or so year intervals, and getting ready to announce ‘investments’ to continue the new version of the model at those plants,"" Mordue said. ""Those launches can be positioned as ‘wins’"" for Trump.
We did not find any long-term data to put the scope of the three recent carmaker announcements into a historical context, but the past few years have seen something of a renaissance in new automobile manufacturing investment, much of it in electric vehicles.
From 2000 to the end of September 2024, companies announced $208.8 billion of investments in electric vehicle manufacturing and the creation of about 240,000 jobs, according toAtlas Public Policy, a research and consulting firm in Washington, D.C.
A big factor in this build-out, experts said, are two laws signed by President Joe Biden, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided federal incentives to redouble the U.S. manufacturing base.
Of the $208.8 billion of investments tracked by Atlas, more than half was announced since Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. About three-quarters of that investment was under construction or operational by October 2024, the group said.
""It's clear that this is part of an ongoing, multi-year trend upwards,"" said Atlas’ founder, Nick Nigro.
Other types of manufacturing have also seen a distinct uptick since the passage of those laws; according to theTreasury Department, overall manufacturing construction spending, adjusted for inflation, has doubled since the end of 2021.
The Trump White House downplayed the value of Biden-era investments, pointing to a Financial Timesanalysisthat found roughly 40% of the investments funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and another Biden-signed bill, the CHIPS and Science Act, were paused or delayed, totaling $84 billion.
The White House also cited news reports of auto manufacturers that abandoned electric vehicle goals in 2024, includingVolvo,FordandMercedes-Benz.
Trump said, ""We have automobile plants being built at levels we've never seen … and they're going up fast.""
The White House pointed to announcements of major U.S. investments by Hyundai, Honda and Stellantis since Trump took office.
With one exception, these were reallocations of investments at existing facilities, rather than new plants. Building a plant, or even increasing production at an existing plant, can take years, and it remains to be seen whether these plans will come to fruition.
Trump came into office after several years of automotive manufacturing construction investments under Biden. Two months into Trump’s administration, it’s too early to say whether his policies have generated additional industry growth. We found no data to support his statement that the current growth plans are unprecedented.
The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

"Phoenix’s wildfire risk linked to climate change and invasive plants, not Bill Gates",Loreben Tuquero,"March 28, 2025","Scientists say metro Phoenix is more likely to experience wildfires than it once was, and a social media user claimed Microsoft Corp. co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has something to do with it.
""You can't make this stuff up. So Bill Gates wants to build a smart city in Arizona, called Belmont,"" aMarch 4 Facebook post’s narrator said, telling viewers that Gates bought 25,000 acres of land west of Phoenix with other billionaires.
""Now there's been an increased risk of wildfires in the areas surrounding the proposed sites, and you guessed it, now insurance companies are starting to cancel wildfire policies in the areas. Sounds familiar to something else,"" the narrator said as the words ""L.A."" and ""Maui"" flashed above his head. The video referenced multiple news articles but misinterpreted their content.
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The Facebook video cited anAxiosarticle with information about climate risk firm First Street’sreportthat more than half of Phoenix properties are at risk of being affected by wildfires in the next 30 years, in part because of shifting wind patterns brought about by climate change.
Scientists and researchers also told Axios that metro Phoenix has vulnerabilities similar to those that contributed to wildfires in Maui and the Los Angeles area. Those risk factors include climate change and highly flammable invasive plants.
However, there’s no credible evidence to link Arizona’s increased wildfire risk to a subsidiary of Gates’ asset management company’s purchase of landaround 50 miles westof Phoenix.
In 2017,mediareportedthat a Gates-linked investment firm, Mt. Lemmon Holdings, spent $80 million on a 24,800-acre property named Belmont located just outside Buckeye, Arizona.
Mt. Lemmon Holdings is controlled by Cascade Investment LLC, which invests Gates’ money, Arizona Centralreported.
Gates’ office referred PolitiFact to Cascade Investment LLC, which declined to comment.
Apress releaseon the investment read, ""Belmont will create a forward-thinking community with a communication and infrastructure spine that embraces cutting-edge technology, designed around high-speed digital networks, data centers, new manufacturing technologies and distribution models, autonomous vehicles and autonomous logistics hubs."" The developers do not call it a ""smart city,"" but it generally meets the description.
PolitiFact looked at a satellite image of the Belmont area, based on amappublished by the Arizona State University, and found it remains mostly vacant.
The term ""smart city"" generally encompasses cities that use technology to operate more efficiently, such as to improve traffic flow, adding sensors and cameras and creating apps to facilitate communication between residents and the city.

"In Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Crawford claims Schimel wants to be part of Trump support network",D.L. Davis,"March 28, 2025","In the race for ideological control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, candidates Brad Schimel and Susan Crawford have clashed over a number of issues, including school choice, union rights, abortion and even Elon Musk.
Now, during a March 12, 2025, debate, Crawford, a liberal Dane County judge, accused Schimel, a conservative Waukesha County judge, of courting national Republican figures including Musk and Republican President Donald Trump.
""Look, Brad Schimel said that he wanted to be part of Donald Trump's support network,"" Crawford said during the debate. ""That's a very partisan statement, and that is exactly why Elon Musk is involved here; in the fact that he's got aTesla lawsuitgoing in the state of Wisconsin and thinks it might be good to have some influence over the Wisconsin judiciary.""
When it was his turn to speak, Schimel did not immediately address Crawford’s remark about his aim of being part of a Trump support network. But Crawford’s claim that Schimel ""said that he wanted to be part of Donald Trump’s support network,"" piqued our interest.
The wording is important. It amounts to Crawford characterizing what Schimel has said, which is what we will examine. It’s similar to a claim we did in which Schimel – without evidence of any past statements or rulings —declared that part of Crawford’s agenda was to ""eliminate school choice.""
Let’s take a look.
When asked for evidence to support the claim, Crawford’s campaign spokesman Derrick Honeyman pointed to news articles, only one of which was on point.
That March 6 article from theWisconsin Examinerpointed to the video of Schimel speaking in Waukesha County to a group of canvassers associated with Turning Point USA — a right-wing political group led by conservative activist Charlie Kirk that has become active in Wisconsin’s Republican Party. In thevideoposted to YouTube, Schimel tells the canvassers that after the election of Trump, ""the job’s not done.""
""There are a heck of a lot of people who voted on Nov. 5 because they were excited about a movement for America who don’t see why they should vote again for April 1,"" Schimel told the audience. ""They don’t understand that there’s more to it…Donald Trump doesn’t do it by himself. There has to be a support network around him.""
When we asked the Schimel campaign if they had any additional context for the remark, spokesman Jacob Fischer in an email sent a fuller transcript of the statement and added: ""As you can see, he was talking about a network of support that is needed to win.""
Here is what the Schimel team sent, with the additional context in bold:
""There are a heck of a lot of people who voted on November 5 because they were excited about a movement for America, who don't see why they should vote again for April 1. They don't understand that there's more to it, that it wasn't just about - that Donald Trump doesn't do this by himself. There has to be a support network around him,and that, you know, they filed over 70 lawsuits against him since he took the oath of office barely a month ago, over 70 lawsuits to try to stop almost every single thing he's doing, because they don't want him to get a win. They're so desperate for him to not get a win that they won't let America have a win. That's what they're doing.""
While Fischer said the additional context indicates Schimel is talking about a ""network of support that is needed to win,"" in our view, that is not entirely clear. Indeed, Schimel talks specifically about lawsuits being filed as a mechanism to stop Trump.
So, Crawford is a bit off base in that Schimel did not directly say he wants to be part of a support network, Schimel certainly talked in the framework of a get-out-the-vote effort for his own candidacy, while citing lawsuits being used as a weapon to slow Trump down.
The other article cited as backup by the Crawford campaign was a March 12, 2025Milwaukee Journal Sentinelcolumn by Daniel Bice, which described a mailer by Trump ally Musk’s super PAC that touted Schimel’s support for Trump.
""Conservative Brad Schimel will support President Trump's agenda!"" the mailer says. ""Together, we won the White House. Now it's time to win the courthouse!""
To be sure, the ""now it’s time to win the courthouse"" remark was not said by Schimel, and as such does not go directly to Crawford’s claim.
But it is one of several examples of Trump and his followers backing Schimel, and Schimel leaning into support from Trump.
Donald Trump Jr.and Turning Point Action founder Charlie Kirk backed Schimel in front of hundreds at a March 17, 2025 event in Oconomowoc. And on March 21, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform calling on his supporters to vote for Schimel.
""All Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel,"" Trump posted.
Likewise, Schimel has been open about his support for Trump. According to aMilwaukee Journal Sentinel report, he dressed up as Trump in a garbage worker outfit — a nod toTrump's donning of a reflective vest during the 2024 presidential campaign— while playing bass with his band at a Halloween party last year. He attended Trump’s inauguration earlier this year. And, while appearing at a March 15 ‘MEGA MAGA Rally’ in Waukesha County, Schimel posed for photos in front of an oversized Trump inflatable with a ""Vote Brad Schimel Supreme Court"" poster on its chest.The Schimel and Trump inflatable photo or references to it appeared online in various places, including the X account ofMilwaukee Journal Sentinelcolumnist Dan Bice.
During a debate, Crawford said: ""Brad Schimel said that he wanted to be part of Donald Trump's support network.""
Clearly Schimel strongly supports President Trump and Trump has backed Schimel in the race, even though the race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court is technically non-partisan. In a nutshell, although Schimel does not come straight out and say he wanted to be part of a Trump support network, his public pronouncements and campaign literature clearly indicate his affinity for a Trump support network.
For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

Don’t trust videos saying you can erase your student loans by filing a student privacy law complaint,Claire Cranford,"March 27, 2025","After the Department of Government Efficiency gained access to student loan databases, some social media posts promoted a federal privacy law as the key to debtholders’ financial freedom.
All you have to do, the posts said, is file a complaint with the Education Department requesting your loans be forgiven on the grounds that DOGE violated theFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974by gaining access to personal loan information.
The law seeks to protect access to student education records from unauthorized parties and to give students, parents and guardians access to their own educational records.
""I’m about to get all my loans forgiven, and so are you,"" a womansaid in a Feb. 8 TikTok post.""Elon Musk being around our private, sensitive information is a definite breach of data and a violation of FERPA.""
""Elon Musk just made a massive mistake,"" a manin March 14 TikTok postsaid, ""And as a result of this mistake, people are getting their student loans forgiven and removed off of their credit report.""
TikTok identified these videos andotherslikethemas part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read moreabout PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.)
But if you’re looking for debt relief, we have bad news for you. Submitting a complaint on the basis of a violation of the 1974 student privacy law won’t forgive your loans.
These posts began cropping up on Feb. 9, afterThe Washington Postreported on Feb. 4 that DOGE gained access to 16 Department of Education and Office of Personnel Management databases, including student loan databasescontainingmore than 40 million borrowers’ personally identifying information.
Afederal judgein Maryland, on March 24,issuedapreliminary injunctionblocking DOGE from accessing people’s private data at the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management and calling it a likely violation of federal privacy laws. The ruling came in response to alawsuitfiled by the American Federation of Teachers and other labor unions against these federal agencies. The agencies have filed notice of their intent to appeal.
The University of California Student Association brought a separate butsimilar caseagainst the Education Department; it is pending in a D.C. federal court.
These TikTok posts sharingtemplate languagefor people to use to file Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act violation complaints to get their debts canceled are off-base. That’s because there’s no legal path for loan forgiveness through that law.
In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled inGonzaga v. Doethat although the Education Department can sue schools on the basis of violations of the 1974 law, individual people can’t.
The law applies to all educational institutions that receive federal funding. If the Education Department finds any school violating it, the department may withhold funding from the institution. Law violations extend to personal information collected as a result of educational data collection, such as grades, disciplinary records, and personally identifiable information. But it does not provide individual students with a direct legal course of action against their schools, nor does the law have any relationship to the federal loan process overseen by the Education Department, said LeRoy Rooker, former director of the Education Department’s Family Policy Compliance Office and an expert on this law.
""I'm not sure what you even have to go on here that would be any basis for filing a complaint,"" Rooker told PolitiFact. ""FERPA is protecting student privacy rights, giving students access to records, protecting the privacy of them, that sort of thing. And student loans are student loans. You have a legal obligation for repaying those, and a FERPA violation would have no relation.""

Hegseth says leaked Signal group text didn’t have ‘war plans’. But screenshots show attack details,Grace Abels,"March 26, 2025","Standing on a Hawaii runway, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told areporterMarch 24, ""Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that."" The next day, herepeatedthe statement.
The Trump administration’s Signal group texts told a different story.
On March 24, The Atlantic magazine Editor in Chief Jeffrey Goldbergdetailedhow he was accidentally added to a group chat on the messaging appSignalwith senior Trump administration officials discussing an impending airstrike on U.S. adversaries in Yemen.
In the initial story, Goldberg said the ""war plans"" he received in the chat mentioned ""precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing."" Goldberg did not include detailed messages about the military strikes because of his concerns about publishing sensitive security information.
The National Security Councilconfirmedthe authenticity of the thread and said it would review how Goldberg’s number was added to the chain.FollowingWhite Houseand Hegseth denials that ""war plans"" were discussed, The Atlantic  published the full text thread. The messages releasedMarch 26show Hegseth sent information about when aircraft and drones would launch, when bombs would drop and the expected movement of targets.
(Screenshot of Pete Hegseth message in Houthi PC small group chat. Originally published byThe Atlantic.)
When we contacted the White House for comment, a spokesperson pointed us to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’spost on Xthat ""no ‘war plans’ were discussed.""
The U.S. struckIran-alignedHouthi rebels March 15 because they have repeatedlyattacked ships in the Red Seasince the October 2023 start of the Israel-Hamas war.
After The Atlantic’s second story, National Security Adviser Mike Waltzwroteon X, ""No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS."" Hegseth made asimilar poston X, saying released messages included no names or targets, which meant ""those are some really shitty war plans."" Secretary of State Marco Rubio alsosaid,""There was no war plans on there.""
The military doesn’t officially use the term ""war plans,"" military experts said. The most in-depth military plans are detailed — hundreds or even a thousand pages — and include information about force deployment.
Still, most experts we talked to said that civilians would broadly and rightly consider the kinds of details included in the Signal messages to be specific plans.
After The Atlantic published the messages in their entirety, Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at Brookings Institution, said, ""Short of giving target coordinates, it’s about as specific as it gets.""
In theinitial article, Goldberg said Hegseth’s messages contained ""operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.""
In aninterview with MSNBChost Jen Psaki after the story’s publication, Goldberg said the messages contained ""the specific time of a future attack, specific targets, including human targets meant to be killed in that attack, weapon systems, even weather reports. … He can say that it wasn't a war plan, but it was a minute by minute accounting of what was about to happen.""
TheMarch 26 follow-up articlein The Atlantic included these messages from Hegseth:
""TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/ CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.""
""1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)""
""1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)""
""1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)""
""1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets)""
""1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts – also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.""
""MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)""
""‘We are currently clean on OPSEC’—that is, operational security.""
""Godspeed to our Warriors.""
Military experts said the texts do not amount to a full plan but contained alarmingly specific details.
""The phrase ‘war plan’ often (but not always) refers to a more comprehensive planning document, which can run hundreds of pages, with details of how the U.S. military intends to pursue a particular military objective,"" said Nora Bensahel, professor of practice at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and contributing editor to theWar on the Rocks, a website that covers national security.
After seeing the messages, Bensahel said, ""These are clear operational plans for the use of military force. I don’t see how the administration can claim these are not war plans, because they are clear plans for war.""
A 2023 Defense Departmentguidedefines an operation plan, aka an OPLAN, as ""a complete and detailed plan containing a full description"" and a ""timephased force and deployment list.""
""We have OPLANs as a contingency if we have to go to war,"" said Ty Seidule, retired U.S. Army Brigadier General who served in the U.S. Army for more than three decades and is a Hamilton College visiting professor of history. ""Like we had for Iraq in 1990 and 2003. Those run to the thousands of pages and include incredible detail.""
The text messages did not amount to an OPLAN, Seidule said, but rather the ""CliffsNotes"" version, with ""all the important details of a military operation"" and ""clearly a security breach of the first order.""
The newly revealed texts ""amount to operational details from a concept of the operation (CONOP) or in this case, colloquially, a strike package,"" said Heidi A. Urben, a Georgetown University professor of practice and former military intelligence officer.
Seidule said Hegseth has a point that the text exchange wasn’t a lengthy war plan, but ""what he did use was all the important details of a joint operation against an enemy force, which is worse.""
Thane Clare, who served in the Navy for 25 years and retired as a captain, said since the Defense Department doesn’t use the term ""war plan,"" that ""technically gives Hegseth et al a completely disingenuous out."" Clare is now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent defense analysis source.
However, Clare said, ""the Yemen chat is 100 percent sensitive operational information that reveals critical details of imminent operations.""
Military experts saw many security problems with administration officials using Signal to communicate the plans.
""Everyone in the intel-defense community knows that Signal provides PGP, pretty good protection,"" said Robert L. Deitz, a George Mason University public policy professor who was National Security Agency general counsel and senior counsel to the CIA director. ""It is great for kids planning a teenage drinking party. It will keep their parents out of the loop. But no half-way serious intel organization in the world is blocked by PGP.""
Hegseth said, ""Nobody was texting war plans"" in the Trump administration Signal group text about bombing Yemen.Whether it was a ""war plan"" is a semantic argument. While there is no military definition of a ""war plan,"" the messages included sensitive operational details about military action, which is akin to a plan. The text messages included information about the exact timing of impending strikes, weapons used and details about ""target"" movements and kills. The messages included a specific time with the message, ""THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP.""
The military devises detailed, very involved and lengthy plans for sensitive operations. That doesn’t mean this wasn’t a plan, including timestamps for actions to come.

PolitiFact no encontró evidencia de que la orden de Trump prohíbe hablar español o que exista una nueva ley sobre eso.
Aquí te contamos los hechos.
La orden de Trumpdiceque los directores de agencias ""no están obligados a modificar, eliminar ni suspender de ninguna manera la producción de documentos, productos u otros servicios preparados u ofrecidos en idiomas distintos del inglés"".
La orden revoca unaorden ejecutivadel expresidente Bill Clinton que requería que los programas federales — y los programas estatales y locales con asistencia federal — ofrezcan a las personas que no hablan inglés acceso a sus servicios.
""Sin embargo, aún existen leyes que exigirían a ciertas entidades gubernamentales traducir, o de lo contrario, violarían ciertos derechos constitucionales"", dijo Anne Lofaso, profesora de leyes en la Universidad de West Virginia.
Entre esas leyes están laLey de Cuidado de Salud a Bajo Precio,la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidady laCláusula del Debido Proceso de la Enmienda 5.
""El presidente no puede usar una orden ejecutiva para ignorar estatutos federales"", nos dijoMark Graber, profesor de leyes en la Universidad de Maryland, experto en ley constitucional. ""Si un estatuto federal explícita o implícitamente requiere que se provean servicios en otro idioma que inglés, la rama ejecutiva debe cumplir"".
La orden de Clinton también dirigía al Departamento de Justicia y a otras agencias a proveer guianza sobre cómo se podía implementar elTítulo VI, dijoMy Khanh Ngo, una abogada de inmigración en la American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, por sus siglas en inglés), una organización sin fines de lucro que aboga por los derechos civiles. Este título, parte de la Ley de Derechos Civiles de 1964, dice que ninguna persona debe ser discriminada de recibir beneficios o asistencia federal por su raza, color o país de origen.
No serequiereque un ciudadano hable inglés para poder votar en EE.UU.
La Ley de Derechos Electoralesdiceque no se debe discriminar contra ciudadanos de minorías lingüísticas nativos de Alaska, amerindios, asiáticos e hispanos. La ley requiere que se de asistencia y materiales tantos escritos como orales en otros idiomas.
La Ley de Derecho al Votode 1965 también manda a algunas jurisdicciones en EE.UU. a proveer materiales en otros idiomas. Esta usadatosdel Censo de EE.UU. para ver cuales estados deben ofrecer asistencia en otros idiomas.
Anteriormente, el Departamento de Justiciademandóa jurisdicciones por no proveer materiales en otros idiomas.
Expertos en ley constitucional nos dijeron que la orden ejecutiva de Trump no prohíbe al Departamento de Justicia de demandar a localidades que no cumplan con la ley.
""En teoría el Departamento de Justicia está obligado a enforzar todas las leyes"", Graber dijo.
Alrededor de 68 millones de personas en EE.UU.hablanotro idioma que el inglés en casa,segúndatos del Census del 2019 publicados en 2022. Se hablan al menos350 idiomasy el segundo más hablado después del inglés es el español, con42 millonesde hablantes.
Antes de la orden de Trump,32 estadosya habían designado el inglés como su idioma oficial.
Estudios demuestran que nuestra sociedad trata a las personas de forma muy diferente según su fluidez en inglés, nos dijoRussell McClain, un deán asociado y profesor en la escuela de leyes en la Universidad de Maryland, quien ha estudiado antropología lingüística.
""La orden ejecutiva no existe en un vacío. La orden, la actual retórica anti inmigratoria y muchos otros factores sociales, en conjunto, sin duda tienden a marginar a quienes no dominan el Inglés Americano Estándar, marcándolos como ‘otros’ o ‘diferentes’"", McClain dijo. ""Esto puede erosionar la confianza en las estructuras y sistemas sociales, posiblemente debilitando importantes aspiraciones sociales"".
Una publicación en TikTok dice que Trump anunció una nueva ley que prohíbe a los inmigrantes hablar español en público en EE.UU.
Eso no es cierto.
Una orden de Trump revocó otra orden de Clinton que requería a programas federales proveer servicios para personas que no hablan inglés.
Pero la orden de Trump no prohíbe que las personas hablen español en público.

Arlington National Cemetery’s website appears to have permanently removed several categories for notable people, including ""African American History,"" ""Hispanic American History"" and ""Women’s History."" A cemetery spokesperson told PolitiFact on March 24 that about 40 profiles once listed under those three categories that were not included in any other category were temporarily removed from the website. Within a two-week period, all the profiles were republished in different categories, the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said Powell previously had been included under ""African American History,"" but was also featured in ""Politics & Government,"" so he remained on the website the entire time. (Powell still appears underthat categoryas of March 25.)
The cemetery’s media team released a March 19statementthat it is working to comply with the Trump administration’s executive orders and the Defense Department’s instructions about diversity, equity and inclusion.
The March 19 statement also said, ""We want to clarify that no service members have been permanently removed from the ‘Notable Graves’ section of our website. … All profiles of individuals from the previously listed categories ‘African American History,’ ‘Hispanic American History’ and ‘Women’s History’ can be found in other categories, such as ‘Prominent Military Figures,’ ‘Politics and Government,’ or ‘Science, Technology and Engineering’ (to name a few examples), based on the person’s historical contributions to our nation.""
As of March 25, Powell’sbiographyappeared on the cemetery’s ""Notable Graves"" list, among people categorized as ""Prominent Military Figures."" The site says that group includes people ""historically significant primarily for their military leadership and service.""
""Vietnam veteran Gen. Colin Powell was the first African American to hold three of the U.S. government’s highest positions: national security advisor (1987-1989), chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1989-1993), and secretary of state (2001-2005),"" the sitesaid. ""The son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell grew up in the South Bronx and enrolled in Army ROTC during college. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1958. By 1989, he had risen to the rank of four-star general.""

"LaLota says he was voting to protect Medicaid, other programs. The budget resolution doesn’t do that",Julie Appleby,"March 25, 2025","On Feb. 25, Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., voted in favor of aHouse budget resolutionthat calls for sharp cuts in spending across a vast array of government areas. Medicaid is among the programs that could be at risk — catapulting it to the center of the political debate.
President Donald Trump has insistedhe won’t harm Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security benefits, saying his administration is looking to root out fraud.But Democrats have pushed back, saying the sheer size of the proposed cuts will result in harm to the Medicaid program, its enrollees, and medical providers.
A KFF tracking pollhas found widespread public support for Medicaid, which suggests efforts to cut the program could face political headwinds. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
LaLota, who represents part of Long Island,posted a videofor his constituents explaining his position: ""I voted yes on a budget resolution that protects Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid while cutting some spending elsewhere."" Because much of his video focused on Medicaid, we did too. We found that his statement in this regard was layered with mischaracterizations and inaccuracies. Still, in his video, LaLota advises his constituents to get their information straight from him, saying, ""I’ll always be honest with you.""
We asked LaLota’s office for the information he used to back up his statement. The budget resolution makes no cuts to those programs, he wrote in a statement emailed by his communication aide Mary O’Hara. ""Rather, it opens the door to protect Medicaid with common-sense solutions which ensure its availability for those Americans who qualify, including the removal of illegals from the rolls, work requirements for able-bodied adults, and the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse.""
Let’s parse what the resolution does say and do, and the changes it could trigger for Medicaid.
Budget resolutions are not law, but rather a blueprint that guides lawmakers on budget-related legislation. The House-passed resolution —approved with 217Republicans voting for it and 214 Democrats and one Republican against — is just one part of the budget process. The Senate also has a say, so changes are possible.
As written, the resolution seeks broad spending reductions across a range of areas overseen by various committees. It specifically asks the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to submit proposals ""to reduce the deficit by not less than $880,000,000,000 [$880 billion] for the period of fiscal years 2025  through 2034.""
It does not say it would protect Medicaid. The word Medicaid is nowhere in the document. It does not prescribe any specific action on the program , such as instituting work requirements for recipients. Lawmakers separately draft legislation to make program adjustments to achieve the spending cut targets.
A little background: Medicaid is a state-federal program that provides medical coverage to lower-income residents, as well as payments to nursing homes for caring for seniors and disabled residents. Medicaid and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Programcover more than 79 million people.
Medicare is the federal programthat provides health insurance coverage for some disabled people and most people over age 65. More than 68 million people are enrolled.
The resolution directs the committee to draft legislative language that would cut spending from areas under its jurisdiction, which include Medicaid and about half of Medicare.
Social Security is mainly overseen in the House by the Committee on Ways and Means. The panel also shares jurisdiction over Medicare with Energy and Commerce.
Policy expertsand the Congressional Budget Officehave said that, after removing Medicare from consideration, there’s not enough under the committee’s jurisdiction to cut $880 billion without substantially reducing Medicaid spending. (Medicare is generally considered a third rail because its beneficiaries are a powerful voting bloc.)
Indeed, of the $8.8 trillion in projected spending under the committee’s purview for the 10-year period, Medicaid accounts for $8.2 trillion, or 93%.
""Even if the committee eliminated all of non-Medicare and non-Medicaid spending, they would still have to cut Medicaid by well over $700 billion,"" said Alice Burns, an associate director of KFF’s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
Adding work requirements — most Medicaid recipients already have jobs — would not yield that level of savings andcould increase state costs. Other cuts suggested by Republicans, including capping federal spending per enrollee, reducing federal matching dollars, and eliminating the use of provider taxes, which states use to pay for their share of Medicaid spending,  could force states to cut spending or find new revenue sources.
""Cuts to Medicaid could mean eliminating coverage for children, parents, working adults or those who might need long term care; limiting benefits; or cutting payment rates for health plans or providers. These choices could come at a time when state revenue growth is slowing, and most states face requirements to pass balanced budgets,"" according to an analysis written by Robin Rudowitz, vice president of the KFF Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
The downstream effects if the House-passed budget resolution were enacted would be wide-ranging and significantly alter the safety net program , said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University.
He noted growing opposition to such large-scale Medicaid cuts from ""beneficiaries and parents of children with disabilities, families with parents in nursing homes, and from health care providers.""
""Medicaid cuts are highly unpopular even among Trump voters,"" he said.
Opposition to Medicaid cuts helped kill the 2017 attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act during the first Trump administration, noted Joseph Antos, a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute.
Antos thinks the current spending cut target is unrealistic and will likely not survive the effort to merge the House budget blueprint with what the Senate wishes to do.
""Ultimately, the problem is you can’t take that much out of Medicaid,"" Antos said.
LaLota’s focus on immigrants lacking legal statusas a way to reduce federal spending on Medicaid is also misleading.
A number of states, including New York, offer coverage to children or adults regardless of immigration status, but they can use only state money to pay for such programs.
""States cannot use federal funding to cover undocumented immigrants,"" Burns said. So removing them ""won’t do anything for the deficit reduction targets.""
LaLota said, ""On Feb. 25, I voted yes on a budget resolution that protects Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid while cutting some spending elsewhere.""
His statement is inaccurate and mischaracterizes laws and the language included in the budget resolution, creating a false impression of what his vote supported.
The 32-word sentence that directs the Energy and Commerce Committee to trim $880 billion over 10 years from programs it authorizes does not include any protections, guardrails, or specific directions for the panel to follow.

Why you should be skeptical of that ‘leaked’ audio of JD Vance criticizing Elon Musk,Grace Abels,"March 24, 2025","From X to TikTok, several users claimed to share ""leaked"" audio of Vice President JD Vance expressing frustration with billionaire businessman and presidential adviser Elon Musk.
""Leaked audio of JD Vance in a jealous rant,"" one X user posted March 23. ""Let’s just say JD Vance is no fan of Elon Musk and thinks he makes him look bad.""
Let’s just say, the audio does not appear legitimate.
The post included a muffled audio clip that sounds like Vance is saying, ""He's making us look bad. He's making me look bad…he has the audacity to act like he is an elected official. I am an elected official, I am the important one in this situation.""
Without naming Musk, the voice in the clip describes the person as South African and references ""his cars.""

The account @valentinbeatzpostedthe oldest version, and the account @josey6529postedthe most viral video. Both accounts have previously posted videos critical of the Trump administration.
The audio clip thenmigratedtoX, with some accounts appearing toadd more audio distortion.
There are many signs the audio clip is not authentic.First, the TikTok users did not explain how they obtained leaked audio of Vance speaking in private. The videos do not provide context about where or when the audio was recorded, or more details about the source.Vance’s communications directorpostedMarch 23 on X that ""this audio is 100% fake and most certainly not the Vice President."" On March 24, Vanceposted on X: ""It's a fake AI-generated clip.""On that point, we reached out to V.S. Subrahmanian, a computer science professor who heads Northwestern University’s Security and AI Lab.
Subrahmanian said the high amount of background noise is a sign of potential manipulation. ""We have previously seen the use of background noise to confound automated deep fake detectors.""But after isolating the speaker’s voice, Subrahmanian analyzed the audio using 20 different deepfake detector algorithms. Seven out of 20 of the algorithms found it to be ""likely fake"" with a higher probability, the remaining 13 found it to be likely fake with a lower probability.His conclusion was that the audio is likely fabricated and ""possibly generated via artificial intelligence.""
A viral video claims to be ""leaked"" audio of Vance criticizing Musk. But an expert who reviewed the audio found signs that it might have been AI generated and is likely fabricated.

"Netflix hit show ‘Adolescence’ was not based on Southport, England, murders of three young girls",Jeff Cercone,"March 21, 2025","Netflix’s new crime drama ""Adolescence"" has been a hit, with more than24 million viewerstuning in during its first four days streaming.
The four-part, limited series is about a 13-year-old white British boy accused of fatally stabbing a female classmate, and the effects of the boy’s arrest on his family.
Ian Miles Cheong, a conservative social media influencer, accused the streaming network of basing it on a real-life killer and changing his race as part of ""anti-white propaganda.""
""Netflix has a show called Adolescence that’s about a British knife killer who stabbed a girl to death on a bus and it’s based on real life cases such as the Southport murderer,"" Cheong wrote in a March 19X post. ""So guess what. They race swapped the actual killer from a black man/migrant to a white boy and the story has it so he was radicalized online by the red pill movement.""
Cheong’s post had 12,000 reshares, 72,000 likes and 4.5 million views as of March 21, and received a response from X owner Elon Musk,who wrote, ""wow.""
The murder Cheong refers to is a July 29, 2024,stabbing attackat a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class in Southport, a seaside town about 17 miles north of Liverpool, England. Three young girls were killed and 10 other people were injured.
But, as several replies to Cheong’s post correctly pointed out, the Netflix show isn’t based on a single real-life case, and it was already in production before the Southport attack happened.
Cheong did not respond to a request for comment through an X message.
Axel Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time of the killing, was sentenced in January to more than 50 years in prison after pleading guilty to three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and other charges. Rudakubana, who is Black, is not a migrant, as Cheong’s post said. Rudakubana was born in Cardiff, Wales, to parents from Rwanda,The Associated Press reported.
""Adolescence"" is not based on a particular true crime, series co-creator and writer Stephen Graham said. Graham said he got the idea after reading news reports of young boys involved in knife crimes, hetold the Netflix site, Tudum.
Graham, who also played the boy’s father, said he wanted to explore why these incidents were happening. He, co-writer Jack Thorne and director Philip Barantini wanted the show to explore male rage and fatherhood, Graham said.
Graham also recounted the show’s inspiration in a March 16interviewon Virgin Radio UK, saying he read two separate stories about young boys stabbing girls.

Netflixannouncedthe show March 2024 at a London event, four months before the Southport stabbings. Barantinitold Screen Dailythat Netflix became involved with the show in December 2023, it went into pre-production in February 2024 and began filming in Yorkshire in July 2024.

PolitiFact no encontró ninguna ley que imponga cadena perpetua a inmigrantes ilegalmente en Estados Unidos en lapágina oficial del Congresoque lista propuestas y leyes. El Senado y la Cámara de Representantesno aprobaronleyes el 7 de marzo.
Es ""completamente falso"" que el Congreso haya aprobado una ley imponiendo cadena perpetua a inmigrantes que residen en el país sin ningún estatus legal, nos dijo Gil Guerra, un experto en política migratoria en el Niskanen Center, un centro de estudios.
Ademas, Guerra dijo que la presencia ilegal en Estados Unidos es principalmente tratada como unaviolación civil,no como una ofenza criminal.
Por ejemplo, si una persona se queda en el pais despues de que su visa expiró, o sin autorización, eso es una violación civil que tipicamente resulta en procedimientos de deportación, en vez de un procesamiento penal. Al contrario, si alguien cruza la frontera sur de Estados Unidos ilegalmente, eso es un delito menor bajo la ley federal.
Algunas de las penalidades por estar presente ilegalmente en EE.UU.incluyen:
Deportación de EE.UU.
Posible prohibición de reingresar a EE.UU después de ser deportado (típicamente entre 3 o 10 años).

Does less than 25% of Education Department spending go to students? No,Louis Jacobson,"March 20, 2025","In a March 16 podcastinterview, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., said the Trump administration is right to target the Education Department for cuts.
""The federal Department of Education spends — has a budget of about $280 billion a year. Less than 25% goes to educating our students,"" she said. ""So where does the other $220 billion go? It goes to a bureaucracy, it goes to a consultant, and that consultant then donates money back to the Democrats, and then it goes to a different consultant, and then it goes to"" a nongovernmental organization.
The department handles a lot of money. But budget figures show a large majority of the Education Department’s 2024 spending was directed to students.
Hageman’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.
Congressestablishedthe Education Department in 1979. Until recent cuts by the Trump administration, it employed4,133 people; cuts initiated by Trump this month aim to reduce the workforce to 2,183. The department does not governcurriculum rules; that’s up to states and localities. But it does shuffle a lot of money out the door.
The department’s2024 budgetlisted roughly $200 billion in outlays. Of that, about $80 billion consisted of money that Congress appropriates annually. The rest has been considered mandatory spending, meaning it is allocated based on congressionally approved formulas. (It’s not clear where Hageman’s $280 billion figure came from.)
Determining the exact percentage of the department’s budget that goes to students is tricky, because not every line item in the overall budget says what portion goes directly to students. This is particularly the case for grants the department makes to states and localities; those jurisdictions, not the federal government, distribute the money.
However, at least 71% of the department’s spending goes to students directly, as grants and loans for higher education. These include Pell grants, which are for lower-income students and don’t have to be paid back, and for student loans, which have to be repaid.
""For student aid funding, the vast majority is supporting students,"" said Robert Kelchen, head of the department of educational leadership and policy studies at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville.
Another 25% of Education Department spending ($49 billion in fiscal year 2024) went to states, tribes and local school districts to support K-12 education.
About 10%of school funding comes from federal sources, as opposed to state and local funding. The federal government funds help support two major areas: low-income schools (known as Title I grants under the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act) and education for students with disabilities (which fall under the 1975 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act).
Federal funding is meant to fill funding gaps. Many localities fund schools through property taxes, which can lead to imbalances in funding between wealthier and poorer districts. About60% of public schoolsand26 million studentsget this support.
Without federal grants, many schools would not be able to afford individualized services for students with disabilities.
Because many of these funding streams are ultimately spent by 50 states, hundreds of localities and tribal governments, it’s hard to know exactly what portion of this $49 billion is spent directly on students. Some money supports school construction or school safety, for instance; whether this money is spent on students is open to interpretation.
But even a conservative estimate for dollars spent in this category would add to the 71% spent on students through federal grants and loans.
Another 3% of the department’s budget went to other aspects of higher education, including universities and career technical education. Some of this is general financial support to universities, including to historically Black colleges and universities. It’s hard to know how much of this flowed to students indirectly, but it’s a small share of the department’s budget.
Finally, less than 2% of the department’s budget went to spending on other things. These include research (including the National Assessment of Educational Progress that since 1969 has tracked the states’ K-12 academic progress) along with teacher grants, administrative functions and an inspector general’s office to combat waste and fraud.
Among the department’s responsibilities has been to handle arising numberof complaints from students alleging civil rights violations.
Put it all together, and at least 71%, and possibly up to 90%, of the department’s budget goes to students.
The department ""is largely focused on funding for students to attend college,"" said Antoinette Flores, director of higher education quality and accountability at New America, a center-left think tank. She said the department’s higher-education focus is ""neglected in the administration's reasoning for shuttering the department, which is entirely based on the performance of K-12 schoolchildren,"" according to the White House’spress releaseannouncing major cuts March 20.
Hageman said the Education Department has a ""budget of about $280 billion a year. Less than 25% goes to educating our students.""
About 71% of the $200 billion budget in 2024 went to college students as direct grants and loans. Another 25% went to states, localities and tribes for K-12 schools, including low-income school districts and for educating students with disabilities. Much of this money passed to classroom needs.

"No, JFK Jr. didn’t write a letter saying that former President Joe Biden was ‘a traitor’",Madison Czopek,"March 20, 2025","Days into his second term, President Donald Trumporderednational intelligence officials to plan ""for the full and complete release"" of all records pertaining to President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. On March 18, the governmentreleasedthousands of pages of records and prompted renewed online discussion about the Kennedy family.
Some social media posts honed in on an apparent link to former President Joe Biden.
""Joe Biden implicated in JFK files,"" said one March 18 Facebookpostfrom a pro-Trump account. ""Files reveal JFK Jr. penned a letter to Joe Biden before his (death) beginning with.. ️Dear Senator Biden, ‘You are a traitor…’""
The words accompanied a slightly blurry image of an FBI document dated Sept. 16, 1994. Using red circles and yellow highlights, someone focused on the name ""Sen. Joseph Biden"" and the words ""‘Dear Sen. Biden: You are a traitor … ’ and bearing the signature ‘John F. Kennedy Jr.’""
Another March 18 Facebookpostshared the image and said: ""Part of the JFK files that were released tonight. What do you notice?""
Variations of the narrative also circulated on X: ActorRussell BrandandNewsmax hostDavid Harris Jr.posted about this purported link between John F. Kennedy Jr. and Biden.
The Facebook posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
(Screengrab from Facebook)
The document at the heart of these social media posts wasn’t one of the records released March 18. It is part of the FBI’s investigation into a 1994 death threat letter that was mailed to Biden, who was a U.S. senator at the time. That letter was signed ""John F. Kennedy Jr.,"" but that doesn’t make it authentic. The FBI never named a suspect in its investigation.
The document has been public for years. It is included among the FBI’s ""John F. Kennedy Jr. Part 01""vault records. The Associated Pressfirst gained access to the document by filing a Freedom of Information Actrequestin 2000.
The document featured in the posts begins on page 154 and discussed four fingerprints collected from two pieces of evidence or ""specimens"": an envelope postmarked from Massachusetts and addressed to Biden and a handwritten letter that began, ""Dear Sen. Biden: You are a traitor,"" and was signed, ""John. F. Kennedy Jr.""
The social media posts included a portion of page 155.
The FBI records referred to Biden as the victim and refer to the suspect using law enforcement shorthand for ""unknown subject,"" writing, ""unsub AKA John F. Kennedy Jr."" On pages 156, 160 and 162 the document described the letter as an ""anonymous letter file"" — signaling that the writer was unknown, though Kennedy’s name was used to sign it.
The Associated Press in 2000reportedthat the authorities closed their investigation into the letter at the end of 1994. The records said the letter’s handwriting was analyzed and four latent fingerprints were developed by the lab, but noted ""there are no suspects at this time wherein latent comparisons can be made.""
In 2020, Steven M. Gillon, a University of Oklahoma history professor who also wrote a biography about Kennedy,told PolitiFactthat the FBI didn’t pursue the letter ""because they did not believe that John wrote it.""
""The FBI dismissed it as a hoax,"" Gillon said at the time.

Was Zelenskyy's Pennsylvania visit ‘election interference’? Why experts say no,Amy Sherman,"March 20, 2025","Echoing an attack by Vice President JD Vance, a Facebook post said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy interfered in the 2024 presidential election.
""Zelenskyy is an ungrateful foreigner who engaged in election interference by campaigning for Kamala (Harris) in (Pennsylvania),"" said text on theMarch 1 Facebook Reelposted by Scotty Moore, a Republican who lost a 2023 Florida House race and a 2022 congressional race. The post also included a March ""Fox and Friends"" clip showing Zelenskyy’s September 2024 visit to a Scranton, Pennsylvania, ammunition plant.
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
We contacted Moore for comment but received no reply.
In theFox News clip, the hosts said Zelenskyy went to Pennsylvania with Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat considered a surrogate for then-Democratic presidential nominee Harris, and then-Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. The hosts nodded to Vance’s Feb. 28Oval Office remarks to Zelenskyythat the Ukraine president ""went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.""
In September 2024, Zelenskyyvisitedthe Scranton Army Ammunition Plant tothank its workerswho were producing munitions for Ukraine. Shapiro attended the event in his official capacity, not as a campaign event.
Shapiro, who Harris passed over to be her running mate, sometimescampaigned on Harris’ behalf. Harris did not attend the Zelenskyy event in Scranton.
Then-Sen. Bob Casey and then-Rep. Matt Cartwright, Democrats who faced competitive reelection bids, attended. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.,saidthe event ""failed to include a single Republican.""
Anine-minute videoof the event showed Zelenskyy touring the site, shaking a worker’s hand, posing with workers for photos and writingmessageson ammunition shells. In brief remarks, he said to the workers, ""I wanted very much to come here and to thank you, 400 people, saved millions of Ukrainians.""
Later the same week, Zelenskyy met separately withHarrisand then-Republican presidential candidateDonald Trump.

Shapiro is not the only U.S. governor who Zelenskyy met in 2024. In July that year,Utah Gov. Spencer J. Cox, a Republican, hosted Zelenskyy at the National Governors Association. Officials signed a memorandum of understanding between Utah and a Ukrainian province, committing to work together in multiple areas.
There are straightforward examples of election interference — for example, trying to prevent voters from casting ballots. But some Republicans have used the term ""election inference"" loosely to attack opponents without proven criminal violations.
Foreign election interference can include a cyber attack on election systems or misinformation/disinformation campaigns that often mask that foreign actors are involved, said Ari Mittleman, executive director of Keep Our Republic, a nonpartisan civic education organization.
""The goal is the same — having Americans distrust fellow Americans and doubt the backbone of our democracy — safe and secure elections,"" Mittleman said.
Experts on election interference told us that Zelenskyy’s actions did not amount to foreign election interference.
Federal lawbansforeign nationals from spending money in U.S. elections. Beyond that, foreign election interference gets complicated.
There is no comprehensive definition of foreign election interference, said Asaf Lubin, an Indiana University Maurer School of Law associate professor and expert on cybersecurity.
U.S. Code 2708says the term ""foreign election interference"" means conduct by a foreign person including ""covert, fraudulent or deceptive acts"" with the intent to significantly influence voters or undermine public confidence in the election.
Trump used similar language in a 2018executive order.
Zelenskyy’s visit to Scranton was not covert; it was reported by the media inadvanceandafterhis visit.
Other pieces of legislation ""offer relevant additional rules, though none explicitly define ‘foreign election interference’ in a singular or comprehensive manner,"" Lubin said.
Michael Morley, a Florida State University election law professor, said the phrase ""tends to be used more broadly and nebulously. It isn't a discrete criminal offense for which a person can be prosecuted.""
For example, U.S. federal officials in 2024 charged Iranian intelligence agents accused of a ""hack-and-leak"" operation against the Trump campaign with fraud and identity theft;prosecutorsdescribed the agents’ actions as election interference.
Dov H. Levin, University of Hong Kong associate professor of international politics who specializes in foreign election interference,trackedforeign election interference over 69 years, including by the U.S. and Russia. Levin said that Zelenskyy’s visit to the Pennsylvania factory is not a form of foreign election interference.
None of Zelenskyy’s actions during his Pennsylvania visit ""would be plausibly defined as ‘covert, fraudulent, deceptive, or unlawful’ actions,"" Levin said, citing the words in thefederal code. Visits by foreign heads of state to the U.S. are ""a dime a dozen and usually provoke no reaction — even during election years,"" Levin said.
Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, wrote in an Oct. 1, 2024,essaythat ""(Zelenskyy) may have been unwise or undiplomatic to participate in an event in a swing state without members of both parties present, but it was not, under any definition advanced by the United States or any other democracy, foreign interference.""
Schafer pointed to the Department of Homeland Securitydefinition offoreign interference:  ""malign actions taken by foreign governments or foreign actors designed to sow discord, manipulate public discourse, discredit the electoral system, bias the development of policy, or disrupt markets for the purpose of undermining the interests of the United States and its allies.""
Schafer wrote, ""A visit by a foreign leader to an American factory checks none of those boxes.""
A Facebook post said Zelenskyy ""engaged in election interference by campaigning"" in Pennsylvania for Harris.
In September 2024, Zelenskyy visited a Scranton ammunition plant to thank its workers who were producing munitions for Ukraine. A video of his visit shows Zelenskyy touring the site and thanking workers.
Although Shapiro served as a Harris campaign surrogate, he attended the Scranton event in his official capacity as governor. Harris did not attend the Scranton event. Zelenskyy met with Harris and Trump separately later the same week.
Zelenskyy’s visit to the Scranton plant was not covert, and experts said it doesn’t meet any definition of foreign election interference.

Is Social Security a Ponzi scheme? Fact-checking Elon Musk,Louis Jacobson,"March 19, 2025","In an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, billionaire businessman and White House adviser Elon Musk resurrected a term that Social Security critics have sometimes used to describe the program, calling it a Ponzi scheme.
During the three-hourFeb. 28appearance, Musk said, ""Social Security is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.""
Critics of President Donald Trump and Musk, a White House adviser, used Musk’s comment asevidencethat Trump was looking to cut Social Security, something that Trump repeatedly said hewould not doin his second term.
Musk is not the first person to make this comparison. In 2011, PolitiFact evaluated a similar statement fromformer Texas Gov. Rick Perry. At the time, we noted that a half-dozen left-of-center columnists also called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. However, the statement is inaccurate, as we concluded about Perry’s comment andothertimes.
Although Social Security and Ponzi schemes have some superficial similarities, experts told PolitiFact that crucial differences undercut the comparison.
""Social Security is a transparent, legally mandated, government program that can remain solvent through adjustments to both funds flowing into the system and flowing out of the system,"" said Eric R. Brisker, finance department chair of the University of Akron’s College of Business.
We contacted the White House to ask if Musk wanted to comment, but received no reply.
The term originated withCharles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions in 1920 by promising returns of up to 100% in 90 days on investments in foreign postal coupons. After first-round investors harvested those profits, others flocked to Ponzi, unaware that his ""profits"" consisted of money paid in by other investors.
The continuous flow of new investors Ponzi needed was unsustainable. A Ponzi scheme must keep signing up more and more investors to pay off earlier members, but sooner or later, getting large numbers of new investors becomes impossible. In Ponzi’s case, it failed after about 200 days.

Some Americans may envision Social Security as a program where their payroll tax dollars are held for them, awaiting the time they retire and begin drawing on those dollars for their own benefits. But that’s not how it works.
The Social Security system, which started in 1935, works on a ""pay-as-you-go"" basis that transfers current workers’ payroll tax payments to people who are already retired.
""The vast majority of those taxes have always been paid out immediately from the young to the old, with the promise that tomorrow’s old will in turn receive benefits covered by the taxes paid by tomorrow’s young,"" said Eugene Steuerle, a fellow and Social Security specialist at the Urban Institute think tank.
This structure has some similarities to how new Ponzi scheme investors provide payouts to earlier investors.
""If there are no longer enough workers to provide enough payroll tax contributions to pay out benefits to retired workers, then the system would fail similar to how a Ponzi scheme would fail in the same manner,"" Brisker said.
This hasn’t happened to Social Security, though the forecast isn’t good. Americanlife expectancyhas increased since Social Security’s creation, and so has the number of eligible recipients. As workers of the baby boom generation (born from 1946 to 1964) enter retirement, fewer workers are paying into the system. At the current pace, Social Security’s trust funds won’t be able to pay 100% of benefits by 2035, the 2024Social Security Trustees Reportsaid. The trustees have issued similar warnings for more than a decade.
Finance and Social Security experts listed a half-dozen key differences between the government’s program for seniors and Ponzi schemes.
No. 1: Social Security is not fraudulent.
A Ponzi scheme ""is a fraud intended to mislead investors,"" said Christina C. Benson, an Elon University associate professor of business law. ""Social Security is a legally mandated system that has been in place since the 1930s to serve as a critically important social safety net that allows working Americans to save towards retirement.""
In fact, ""nearly every major developed country in the world has a similar safety net and retirement system in place,"" Benson said.
No. 2: Social Security’s operators do not take a cut.
Unlike with Ponzi schemes, Social Security is not a profit-generating  operation, and the officials who run it do not ""cream off money for themselves,"" Steuerle said.
No. 3: Social Security is operated in the open.
""Social Security is a transparent, government-run program with clear funding mechanisms, compared to Ponzi schemes, which are fraudulent and based on deception,"" Brisker said.
No. 4: Social Security has built-in oversight.
Unlike a Ponzi scheme, Social Security has ""many layers of oversight, regular auditing, regulation, and legal and financial systems in place to ensure accuracy and transparency,"" Benson said.
Although Social Security has beenfound to havemade improper payments, which generally have amounted to around 1% of outlays, these problems were identified because of oversight mechanisms, including the Social Security Administration’s inspector general’s office, the Government Accountability Office, congressional oversight committees, and the boards of trustees of the Social Security trust funds.
No. 5: Social Security offers realistic returns.
Social Security faces a stiff demographic challenge. But its goal is to provide basic income replacement, not to generate get-rich-quick returns.
""Social Security was founded on the idea of providing a minimum sustainability of retirement income,"" Brisker said. ""It never promised unrealistically high gains, unlike Ponzi schemes.""
No. 6: If financially stressed, Social Security is able to adjust its funding or benefit streams.
Unlike a Ponzi scheme, a fiscal imbalance in Social Security can be corrected.
""The adjustments could be very painful, including benefit reductions and tax increases, but they can be done to keep the system solvent,"" Brisker said. ""Ponzi Schemes are fraudulent by design and will eventually fail, with no alternatives to keeping them solvent.""
In addition, beneficiaries can't demand to be paid a ""balance"" in their ""account"" immediately, said Rick Antle, a Yale School of Management accounting professor. ""So there can't be a bank run on Social Security, and problems can be worked out over time.""
Musk said, ""Social Security is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.""
There are some superficial similarities between the two, and given demographic trends, Social Security will need an overhaul in the coming decade to keep benefits flowing.
But experts say the similarities are undercut by several crucial differences.
Social Security is not fraudulent, is transparent, has multiple layers of oversight and doesn’t promise unrealistic returns. Congress can act to address the program’s fiscal imbalance.

"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says measles infection may have benefits, but there’s no conclusive evidence",Jeff Cercone,"March 19, 2025","As U.S. measles infections spread, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a Fox Nation interview there could be some health benefits to getting the measles.
During the March 4episode,Fox’s chief medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel asked Kennedy about people attending measles parties to get infected. Kennedy saidthat he advises against people attending these parties, but also said there could be benefits to ""wild infection.""
Kennedy said:
""I went to measles parties when I was a kid. I went to a chicken pox party, and I had natural immunity.And there's a lot of studies out there that show that if you actually do get the wild infection, you're protected later. It boosts your immune system later in life against cancers, atopic diseases, cardiac disease, etc.It's not well-studied. It ought to be well-studied because we ought to understand those relationships … but I would never advise somebody to get sick. But … what we need is good science on all of these things so that people can make rational choices.""
It’s unclear what studies Kennedy was referencing. The Health and Human Services Department did not respond to a PolitiFact email seeking clarity.
The studies we found showed that research has been inconclusive about any potential links between measles infections and protection from other diseases. Meanwhile, other studies show the virus can suppress a person’s immune system for several years. Because of measles’ dangerous risks — hospitalization, brain damage and death — health experts recommend vaccination to prevent the virus.
As of March 18, Texas hasreported 279 measles cases, resulting in 36 hospitalizations and a child’s death. Including Texas, 14 states had reported 301 confirmed cases as of March 13, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsaid.
Measles killed about 107,500 people worldwide in 2023. Deaths from measles are not common in the U.S. because of widespread vaccination. In addition to the Texas death, authorities wereinvestigatingafter a New Mexico adult who died tested positive for measles.
The bottom line, experts say, is that getting infected with measles can pose serious health risks for people that they wouldn’t face if they were vaccinated. Two doses of the measles vaccine is 97% effective in preventing the virus.
Science Feedback, a publication that fact-checks scientific claims, researched social media claims similar to Kennedy’s statement and found one post citing a 1998studyin what was then a non-peer-reviewed publication about a lower risk of adult cancer for people who had measles. Another post credited a 2015studyabout measles and decreased cardiac disease mortality in Japanese adults.
Both studies had limitations,Science Feedback found, including that they were based on self-reporting through surveys. Neither study proved causation.
Here were the other studies about measles infections and possible effects on cancer and cardiac disease we found:
A 2000 United Kingdomstudysaid childhood infections, including measles, are associated with a lower risk of Hodgkin's disease, a type of cancer. But it didn’t prove causation.
A 2013 Europeanstudyof 1,142 people born in 1947 in England’s Newcastle upon Tyne said childhood infection with measles and influenza was associated with a reduced risk of death from cancer in adulthood, but also said further studies were required to confirm the associations.
The 2013 study’s lead author, Peter Tennant, told PolitiFact it was ""hypothesis generating"" rather than proof of anything.
""Further studies would indeed be required to establish the associations we observe, but I’m not aware of anything similar having been done since,"" said Tennant, a University of Leeds associate professor of health data science. ""Unfortunately, there are very few datasets where it’s possible to conduct a study of this kind.""
Tennant's study found measles and flu were associated with modestly lower risks of death from cancer, and that whooping cough was strongly associated with higher risks of cancer. Because it shows good and bad outcomes for different conditions, ""it cannot be said to support Robert Kennedy's assertion,"" Tennant said.
Other researchers havedebatedwhether a measles infection contributes to cancer.
As for atopic diseases — allergic conditions linked to immune system issues —  Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Kennedy likely was referring to a1996 studyin West Africa that found measles infection may preventatopyin African children.
""That study has not been replicated and other studies have drawn the opposite conclusion,"" Adalja said, pointing to this2000 study.
A sign warning of measles is posted on a glass door as a patients wait in the family medicine wing of at the Texas Tech Physicians of the Permian Basin, Feb. 24, 2025, in Odessa, Texas. (AP)
Health experts said there’s no question that natural immunity from measles can provide long-lasting defense against future measles infections. But purposely getting infected carries risk of serious illness or death. Most people will recover, but studies show that measles can leadto higher riskof other infectious diseases in part because of its toll on the immune system.
""There is a cost in terms of diminished responses to other infections for several years,"" said North Carolina University professor Dr. David Wohl.
Wohl pointed to a2012 studyin macaque monkeys that concluded that a measles infection ""wipes out immunological memory"" of previous viruses encountered and leaves people susceptible to infections ""that would normally be controlled by the immune system.""
The phenomenon is often called ""immune amnesia.""
Infection ""resets our immune system and depletes cells that recognize and respond to other pathogens,"" Wohl said.
No such phenomenon occurs following the measles vaccine, he said.
Some studies show ""measles virus infection temporarily suppresses the immune system and leads to a loss of the diversity and abundance of pre-existing antibodies, thus increasing the risk of other infections,"" said Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor Dr. William Moss.
Three studies show that immune amnesia lasts up to three years after a measles infection, said Dr. David Gorski, a Michigan cancer surgeon who alsoblogsabout medical claims.
One 2019studyexamined 77 unvaccinated children in the Netherlands before a measles infection and two months after. It found the virus eliminated 11% to 73% of the person’s antibodies. The same effect was not seen in vaccinated children, the study said.
Gorski was not aware of any studies that support Kennedy’s claim.
Measles symptoms are generally mild for most people, including a high fever, runny nose and a skin rash. But for patients who are more vulnerable, the outcome can be traumatic.
""No parent wants to see their child end up in hospital, yet children who get measles have a 1 in 5 chance of being hospitalized,"" World Health Organization spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris said in an email. About 1 in 20 people infected get pneumonia and 1 in 1,000 develop encephalitis, a brain infection, she said.
Patricia Stinchfield, the immediate past-president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said taking a chance on natural infection rather than vaccination ""would be like playing infectious disease roulette.""
""Measles was eliminated in the US in 2000 thanks to vaccination. We do not need to see anyone unnecessarily suffer and die a preventable death, and we certainly should not encourage disease over vaccination,"" she said.
Kennedy said ""a lot of studies"" show that getting measles ""boosts your immune system later in life against cancers, atopic diseases, cardiac disease.""
Experts said research on this topic is not conclusive. Some studies have shown an association between measles infections and improved outcomes against those diseases later in life, but that research had limitations and none proved that measles caused those outcomes.

"USDA grant funded research into all-natural menstrual products, not trans menstrual cycles",Grace Abels,"March 19, 2025","It’s ""that time of the month"" — time for false claims about federal spending.Over the past few weeks, the Trump administration has worked to cancel federal spending related to transgender issues, sometimesmischaracterizingprograms.
The latest example comes from U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, a Texas attorney who founded and led the America First Policy Institute, a think tankpromotingPresident Donald Trump’s policies.
""CANCELLED: $600,000 grant to study ‘menstrual cycles in transgender men,’"" Rollins said March 7on X. Rollins, who was sworn in Feb. 13, thanked the American Principles Project, a conservative political advocacy group, that flagged the grant in itsdatabaseof grants promoting ""woke gender ideology.""The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, X accountreposted herstatement, andFox Newsandsocial media postsechoed it.
However, the grant-funded study wasn’t about the menstrual cycles of transgender men, who are people assigned female at birth but who identify as men. The grant funded the research and development offeminine hygiene productsthat use natural fibers such as cotton, wool and hemp.
The project summary included one sentence noting that along with women and girls, transgender men may also menstruate, but it did not say transgender men were the project’s focus.
The U.S. Department of Agricultureawardedthe three-year, $600,000 grant to study feminine hygiene product materials to Southern University and A&M College, a historically black university in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in April 2024.
Theprojectsought to research feminine hygiene products made with natural fibers including cotton, wool and hemp, developing patents for products using those natural fibers and evaluating them in comparison with synthetic products.
The focus on natural fibers may stem from concerns aboutheavy metalsandtoxic chemicalsresearchers have found in common menstrual products. It is unclear whether the presence of these chemicals are linked to negative health effects.The Southern University project envisioned workshops ""to educate young women and adolescent girls about menstruation, methods for managing menstruation, and how to create their own reusable feminine hygiene sanitary products using alternative natural fibers.""Researchers wanted to source materials from Louisiana farmers and planned to use the grant to establish a fiber processing center at the university.
The grant project summary mentioned transgender men once: ""It is also important to recognize that transgender men and people with masculine gender identities, intersex and non-binary persons may also menstruate.""Southern University’s Agricultural Research and Extension Center disputed Rollins’ characterization of this grant.
""This grant, which was reviewed by researchers from throughout the country, is not a study on or including research on menstrual cycles,"" the center’s March 9statement said. ""The term ‘transgender men’ was only used once to state that this project, through the development of safer and healthier FHPs, would benefit all biological women.""
The center offered no additional comment to PolitiFact.
When we reached out to USDA for evidence, a spokesperson said the natural fibers research was a surface-level focus of the grant, while the education component prioritized transgender men.We found no evidence of that, nor did the agency provide any. The education portion’s descriptions include no mentions of transgender men. Itsaysthat workshops will teach young women and girls ""about the biological aspects of menstruation, its role in the reproductive cycle, and the physical and emotional changes that accompany it.""
Rollins said her department canceled a $600,000 federal grant ""to study 'menstrual cycles in transgender men.'""
The grant funded research into natural fiber alternatives for menstrual products, and period health education workshops for ""young women and girls.""
The grant project summary included one reference to transgender men, noting that they ""may also menstruate.""

Rep. Ro Khanna blames Trump team for ending telehealth medicare benefit. That's not quite right.,Suz Redfearn,"March 18, 2025","U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.,posted a TikTok videoFeb. 20 saying he had ""breaking news"" about the fate of Medicare coverage for telehealth visits, which allow patients to see health care providers remotely from their homes.
""Breaking news: The Trump Administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1,"" Khanna said. ""We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts.""
The same day, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services posteda documentonline titled ""Telehealth"" that said, ""Through March 31, 2025, you can get telehealth services at any location in the U.S., including your home. Starting April 1, 2025, you must be in an office or medical facility located in a rural area (in the U.S.) for most telehealth services.""
CMS did not respond to requests for comment about the post. The White House also did not respond to requests for comment.
The telehealth benefit was first put in place as a temporary Trump-era addition to Medicare coverage during the covid-19 public health emergency.
Khanna’s statement took on more significance leading up to the threat of a government shutdown, but late last week Congress averted one by approving a stopgap spending bill.
The expiration date for the benefit has been known since December, when Congress extended coverage around telehealth through March 31. The roughly 90-day reprieve was part of a compromise after then-President-elect Donald Trump and his ally Elon Musk criticized a sweeping, end-of-year legislative package that would have, among other things, continued those benefits for two years.
Their opposition forced Congress to pass a stripped-down version of the end-of-year bill. Telehealth’s two-year extension, included in the initial bill, became collateral damage.
Last week, just as the clock was ticking down, House Republicans passed aspending billfor the rest of the fiscal year that includes another extension of telehealth flexibilities — this one lasting through September. The Senate then cleared the bill for Trump’s signature, with the support of 10 Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
Regardless, the two-year extension proposed in December — or a permanent extension, as Khanna has urged — looks unlikely.
""President Trump and Elon Musk blew up the continuing resolution last December that would have extended these telehealth authorities by two years,"" Khanna told us via email. ""Trump should work with Congress to extend telehealth coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.""
It wouldn’t come free. Permanently extending telehealth for medical care under Medicare could cost taxpayers about $25 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. The CBO calculated five months of expanded telehealth coverage as costing $663 million, and calculated that that would total almost $25 billion through fiscal year 2031 if spending remained level, which it may not do.
Also, the agency and the Government Accountability Office have raised concerns about fraud and overuse of the benefit, among other potential issues.
Congress made Medicare coverage of behavioral health services delivered remotelypermanent in December 2020, but leftother telehealth benefitshanging on by a string. Instead, lawmakers extended them for short periods during the nearly two years since the public health emergency officially ended in May 2023.
""Now, once again, we’ve got another deadline where, if Congress doesn't act, our flexibilities go away,"" said Kyle Zebley, senior vice president of public policy for the American Telemedicine Association.
And if, at some point, the telehealth benefits aren’t extended, is it fair to describe the policy change as a cut? Khanna, for instance, plans to introduce the Telehealth Coverage Act, which would require Medicare to cover seniors' telehealth services.
Politically speaking, it’s a powerful question when trying to leverage public support — and politicians in both parties often accuse their opponents of ""cutting"" federal benefits when they make changes to programs.
""Khanna is overly dramatic,"" said Joseph Antos, a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
If the provision expires, Antos said, ""this is not a Trump cut.""
But beneficiaries might have a different experience. Since the early days of the pandemic — five years now —millions of patientshave come to rely on telehealth for their medical services. That benefit, even with another temporary reprieve, would still be at risk.
According to CMS, more than 1 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries used virtual care services as of 2023. And, after the Trump administration green-lighted telehealth for Medicare recipients in 2020, many private insurers did the same.
Overall telehealth claims rose from fewer than 1% of all commercial claims before the covid pandemic to a peak of 13% in April 2020. Now they stand at close to 5%, according to Fair Health, a nonprofit that tracks health care costs.
Those in the telehealth industry are optimistic about the current extension. The Trump administration, they say, has been sending encouraging signals — even highlighting its previous support of telemedicine in its fact sheet on the launch of the President’s Make America Healthy Again Commission.
""We’ve been sweating bullets,"" Zebley said. ""But it’s been nerve-wracking before. I think we’re going to get it done.""
Antos said, however, that after the extension in the House-passed spending bill, Medicare’s telemedicine benefits could be dead.
Khanna said, ""Breaking news: The Trump administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1. … We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts.""
The statement is partially accurate, because the Trump administration announced the March 31 sunset of Medicare telehealth visits, and some beneficiaries who were using that benefit could see it as a ""cut."" But the claim lacks key context that the expiration date was set by Congress, not the Trump administration.
After Khanna’s claim, Congress extended access to telehealth coverage through September.

"Are Biden pardons 'void' because he used an autopen? No, Trump's claim is False",Louis Jacobson,"March 17, 2025","President Donald Trump claimed some of former President Joe Biden’s pardons are invalid because Biden used an autopen.
""The ‘Pardons’ that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,"" Trump wrote March 17 onTruth Social. He referred to Biden’s pardons of congressional members who served on the committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack.
It’s uncertain to us whether Biden used an ""autopen"" — amechanical devicethat uses a robotic arm with a pen attached — to sign the pardons. Yet, Trump also claimed that Biden ""did not sign"" the pardons and ""did not know anything about them!""
Trump’s post followed hisstatementsdays earlier criticizing Biden’s use of the autopen.
""Everything was signed by autopen — almost everything,"" TrumpsaidMarch 13. ""Nobody has ever heard of such a thing.""
Biden is not the first U.S. president to use an autopen. PresidentsBarack Obama,John F. KennedyandThomas Jeffersonused autopens or mechanized signing devices.
In this photo taken June 13, 2011, Bob Olding, president of Damilic Corp., the leading manufacture of automatic signing machines for replicating authentic signatures, demonstrates the features of the older model Autopen Model 80 in Rockville, Md. (AP)
We found universal agreement among legal scholars that the Constitution doesn’t require a pardon’s direct human signing, and subsequent judicial decisions and legal memoranda support an autopen’s use for similar purposes. Legal scholars also agreed that there is no constitutional mechanism to overturn pardons once granted.
A White House press office spokesperson referred PolitiFact to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s March 17 comments, that were in response to a reporter asking whether White House attorneys had told Trump he has the legal authority to reverse Biden’s pardons because of the autopen.
Leavitt did not directly answer that question but said, ""The president was raising the point that, did the president even know about these pardons? Was his legal signature used without his consent or knowledge?""
When we asked the White House whether Trump ever used an autopen, a spokesperson pointed to Trump’s comments to reporters the previous night on Air Force One. ""I never use it. I mean, we may use it, as an example, to send some young person a letter, because it's nice. … But to sign pardons and all of the things that he signed with an autopen is disgraceful.""
The pardon portion of the Constitution’sArticle II, Section 2, Clause 1says the president has the power to grant pardons, but makes no mention of ""sign"" or ""signature."" More than a half-dozen constitutional law experts told PolitiFact they see no restriction in the Constitution on the use of an autopen.
""The president possesses the power to pardon, but there is no specification (unlike for signing of bills) that this pardon be in writing,"" said Bernadette Meyler, a Stanford University scholar of British and American constitutional law. ""Hence it is not clear that a signature would even be required, as the decision to pardon could be oral rather than written.""
By comparison, Article I, Section 7 says that bills that pass the House and Senate shall be ""presented to the President of the United States; If he approves he shall sign it.""
Frank O. Bowman III, a University of Missouri law professor, pointed to images ofpardonsfrom Abraham Lincoln's presidency, which sometimes do not match each other, nor Lincoln’s documented signature elsewhere.
That’s because ""in the 1800s, the secretary of state, or one of his functionaries, often prepared and signed pardon warrants in the name of the president,"" Bowman said.

In 2005, during George W. Bush’s presidency, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel wrote amemoto the president’s counsel about the legality of using an autopen to sign bills. The department concluded:
""The President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law. Rather, the President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.""
The Justice Department memo also said there are practical reasons for a president to use an autopen, such as when he is away from Washington, D.C., or wants a law to take effect immediately, for example to avert a government shutdown.
""The DOJ opinion does give Biden cover here,"" Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt said.
A 1929 Office of the Solicitor Generalmemo, within the Justice Department, said a pardoned man should be given a ""token"" to show he was pardoned, however, ""that need not have the president’s autograph. If it shall bear the facsimile signature and be certified by an official having charge of the records as having been issued by the President, or by his direction, that shall be sufficient.""
More recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said in a 2024rulingthat ""nothing in the Constitution restricts the President’s exercise of the clemency power to commutations that have been rendered through a documented writing.""
Legal experts agreed that nothing in the Constitution or the law permits pardons to be reversed.
""Pardons are final and irrevocable,"" Kalt said.
In an1869 ruling, a federal court wrote: ""The law undoubtedly is, that when a pardon is complete, there is no power to revoke it, any more than there is power to revoke any other completed act.""
Making the argument that pardons can be reversed is a risk for Trump himself.
""Even under Trump’s conception of unlimited presidential power, a future president could undo anything he did — and I assume he would not be happy with that,"" said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor.
Trump issuedpardons for Jan. 6, 2021, defendants.
""Presidents historically have not personally signed grants of pardons for every individual they granted clemency to,"" notably when granted in large batches such asmass amnestiesfollowing wars, said Dan Kobil, a Capital Law School professor.
Trump’s autopen claims followed posts earlier in March by the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Oversight Project.
""WHOEVER CONTROLLED THE AUTOPEN CONTROLLED THE PRESIDENCY,"" the Oversight Projectwrote March 6 on X.
The Oversight Project wrote that it gathered documents with Biden's presidential signature and found ""all used the same autopen signature"" except for his announcement that he was dropping out of the 2024 race.
The Oversight Project posted about autopens about a dozen times in a week, dubbing it the ""autopen scandal."" Onepostdisplayed signatures for multiple pardons Biden issued Jan. 19, his final full day in office. That was the day hepardonedlawmakers who served on the congressional committee to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack.
The National Archives told the fact-checking websiteSnopesthat official documents published in the Federal Register use a copy of the president's signature provided by the White House.
""At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President's signature to the Office of the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register,"" the National Archives wrote to Snopes. (PolitiFact contacted the National Archives and did not immediately hear back.)
Trump said Biden’s pardons of lawmakers on the committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack ""are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT,"" because ""they were done by Autopen.""
It’s unclear whether Biden signed the pardons with an autopen. But even if he did, a half dozen legal experts said the Constitution doesn’t require that pardons be signed by hand by the president.
Memos by the Office of the Solicitor General in 1929 and the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 2005 both say a president’s hand signature is not needed, and presidents, including Lincoln, routinely had subordinates sign pardons on their behalf.
There is no constitutional mechanism for overturning pardons, and an 1869 judicial ruling found that once delivered, a pardon is final. There is no legal precedent saying pardons are void if they are signed by a machine instead of the president.
The burden of proof is on the speaker, and Trump provided no evidence of a legal path to declaring Biden’s pardons void.
Based on current legal precedent, we rate the statement False.

"Are Girl Scout cookies ‘toxic’? No, experts say study’s findings are misleading",Sara Swann,"March 14, 2025","Concerns about Girl Scout cookies containing toxic substances have been swirling online, but don’t throw away those Thin Mints just yet.
Conservative podcaster Joe Rogan warned in a Feb. 22 episode of his eponymous show that Girl Scout cookies are ""toxic,"" citing a flawedstudythat found tested cookies ""contained levels of glyphosate and heavy metals above (Environmental Protection Agency) water safety limits.""
Moms Across AmericaandGMOScience, two groups that challenge food safety standards and oppose genetically modifying foods, commissioned the December 2024study, ""Danger in the Dough: Unveiling the Toxic Contaminants in Girl Scout Cookies."" It has not been peer reviewed. Moms Across America’s websitelistsHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a former adviser.
Multiplesocial mediauserssharedRogan’s comments and the study’s findings onFacebook,Instagram,X andTikTok, warning that Girl Scout cookies are ""extremely toxic"" and ""contain harmful chemicals.""
The Facebook and Instagram posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
A New York womanfiledMarch 10 a proposed class action lawsuit against Girl Scouts of the USA and its cookie manufacturers, Ferrero USA’s Little Brownie Bakers and Interbake Foods, aka ABC Bakers, alleging Girl Scout cookies contain heavy metals and pesticides. The lawsuit cites this study.
But public health and toxicology experts said the study is misleading and its findings do not show toxic levels of glyphosate and heavy metals in Girl Scout cookies. A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told PolitiFact March 17 that the agency has not issued or recommended any recalls about the cookies.
Moms Across America founder and executive director Zen Honeycutt told PolitiFact that her organization reported its findings to the FDA but had not received a response.
In response to the study, Girl Scouts of the USApostedFeb. 6 on its website that Girl Scout cookies are ""safe to consume."" Girl Scouts said its products are made with ingredients that adhere to food safety standards and regulations set by the FDA, the EPA and other public health authorities.
The study tested 25 samples of Girl Scout cookies from three states, California, Iowa and Louisiana, because states source their ingredients locally. The samples included all but one type of Girl Scout cookie.
Norbert Kaminski, a Michigan State University pharmacology and toxicology professor, said this sample size is too small to draw conclusions about Girl Scout cookies nationwide.
The study said 100% of the cookies tested showed ""very elevated levels"" of glyphosate, a common herbicide. Health Research Institute, an Iowa-based nonprofit research laboratory, conducted the tests, which showed glyphosate levels ranging from 4.05 to 111.07 nanograms per gram.
To put this in perspective, 1 nanogram per gram (ng/g) is equal to 0.001 parts per million (ppm), the measurement unit the EPA uses. And 0.001 ppmwould be equal toputting one drop of water into a 10,000-gallon swimming pool.
So, the largest amount of glyphosate detected in the tested cookies, 111.07 ng/g, equates to 0.11 ppm. That’s within the 0.1 to 400 ppm range, depending on the food product, that theEPA and FDAconsider safe for human consumption.
Dr. Jessica Steier, a public health expert and CEO of the science communication organization Unbiased Science, addressed the study’s findings in aFeb. 11 Substack post. She wrote that a 66-pound child would need to eat more than 9,000 Girl Scout cookies in a day to reach an unsafe amount of glyphosate.
Trace amounts of glyphosate may be found in food or drink products because the herbicide is widely used, the EPAsaid. If foods have an unsafe level of glyphosate, they are subject to government seizure, the agency said.
The study also said 22 of the 25 cookie samples tested positive for five heavy metals: arsenic, aluminum, cadmium, lead and mercury. That count is off; the test results, conducted by the FDA-registered New Jersey Laboratories, showed 19 samples had detectable levels of all five elements. (Honeycutt said ""human error"" caused data discrepancies and that the study would be corrected.)
After converting the test results from parts per billion to parts per million (the EPA’s measurement unit), the amounts detected in the tested cookies ranged from:
Arsenic: 0.0006 to 0.03 ppm

The study’s comparison of the highest detected amounts with the EPA’s safety limits on heavy metals in water causes unnecessary alarm, experts said. An FDA spokesperson also told PolitiFact that such a comparison is not scientifically appropriate.
""Water consumption is vastly different from food consumption,"" Kaminski said. ""People drink liters of water daily, whereas foods like cookies are eaten in much smaller quantities and at less consistent intervals.""
Also, detecting a substance does not mean it poses harm, Kaminski said, because ""modern testing methods are incredibly sensitive and capable of detecting substances at parts per trillion (ppt) or smaller concentrations.""
Steier wrote on Substack that regulatory agencies recognize it’s technically impossible to eliminate heavy metals from all foods, ""which is why the FDA sets practical, science-based action levels rather than requiring absolute zero.""
The FDAsaidenvironmental contaminants, including arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury, can be found in food products because they are in the soil, water or air where foods are grown, raised or processed.
Many foods, including organic foods, can also contain trace amounts of arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury. From 2018 to 2020, the FDAtestedmore than 3,200 food samples, and about one-third had detectable levels of heavy metals. The highest amounts reported vastly exceeded the heavy metal levels detected in these Girl Scout cookie samples.
Social media posts claimed Girl Scout cookies are ""toxic"" because a study showed they contain glyphosate and heavy metals.
Public health and toxicology experts said the study’s sample size was too small to draw conclusions about Girl Scout cookies nationwide. The presence of glyphosate and heavy metals does not mean the cookies pose harm; the levels detected are within or below FDA safety standards.
Trace amounts of glyphosate may be found in food or drink products because the herbicide is widely used. If foods have an unsafe level of glyphosate, the EPA said they are subject to government seizure.
The study also misleadingly compared the cookies’ heavy metal levels to safety limits for water. Experts said people drink much larger quantities of water each day and in consistent intervals, compared with foods such as cookies.
We rate this claim Mostly False.

Karoline Leavitt says tariffs are ‘a tax cut.’ Economists say they aren’t,Louis Jacobson,"March 13, 2025","When Associated Press reporter Josh Boak asked about tariffs in the White House press briefing March 11, the exchange with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt quicklybecame testy.
It also produced a sentence that left economists’ heads spinning: ""Tariffs are a tax cut for the American people,""Leavitt said.
After Leavitt said that, Boak responded, ""I'm sorry, have you ever paid a tariff? Because I have. They don't get charged on foreign companies. They get charged on the importers.""
Leavitt pushed back, calling his question ""insulting.""
""Ultimately,"" she said, ""when we have fair and balanced trade, which the American people have not seen in decades, as I said at the beginning, revenues will stay here, wages will go up and our country will be made wealthy again.""
Boak had asked about President Donald Trump’s pursuit of wide-ranging tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China and other countries during his first eight weeks back in the White House following months ofpromisingAmericans that he would cut their taxes.
The stock market has reacted unfavorably to the prospect of a global trade war. Trump’s decisions to enact tariffs, then delay their implementation, prompted additional market stress. By March 11, the S&P 500, a broad market index, had fallen more than 9% in about three weeks.
Standardeconomic theoryargues that tariffs are indeed a tax on the consumer, if not fully, then at least to a large degree. Moststudiesof Trump’s first-term tariffs showed that consumers were hurt, and the second-term tariffs he’s proposing would be more far-reaching than his first-term tariffs were, with potentially even bigger negative economic impacts.
We asked the White House to explain Leavitt’s assertion, but its response didn’t directly answer our question.
""In his first term, President Trump implemented his America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy that resulted in historic job, wage, and investment growth with no inflation,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said. ""In his second term, President Trump will again implement an America First agenda to reindustrialize the United States and revitalize working class prosperity.""
When we reached out to an ideologically diverse group of economists, they were unimpressed by Leavitt’s assertion.
""The statement that tariffs are a tax cut is nonsensical,"" independent libertarian economist Daniel Mitchell told us.
""I cannot think of any direct way in which a higher tariff is a tax cut,"" said Steve Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis. ""Tariffs are taxes. Higher tariffs are higher taxes.""
""I simply think there is a fundamental misunderstanding about who pays the tariff that is perpetuated by the White House,"" said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who studies international trade. ""It is the importing company who imports the goods from the targeted country that pays the tariff and then passes the cost of that tariff down to the consumer, who pays the raised price for the product, and any sales tax associated with that product.""
""Honestly, it sounds like everything is being put on its head,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. ""Economists don't agree on much, but we agree tariffs are taxes on consumers.""
In 1990, 2000, 2011 and 2021, researcherssurveyedmembers of the American Economic Association, a professional group for economists, to gauge consensus among the group’s members on a range of economic propositions. One proposition asked whether ""tariffs and import quotas usually reduce general economic welfare."" In each of the surveys spanning three decades, 94% to 95% of economists surveyed agreed that tariffs reduced general economic welfare.
So what’s going on here?
We asked economists if any amount of squinting at Leavitt’s statement could produce an economically sound argument.
The answer: Not really. But here are the best cases.
Trump’s supporters might argue that while tariff hikes could cost consumers money up front, the revenue that tariffs generate for the federal government could allow tax cuts down the line.
However, such a scenario would not guarantee tax cuts for typical Americans. At best, it could become a wash for consumers if the money saved from tax cuts roughly equaled the added consumer purchase costs.
There’s good reason to believe that the costs from tariffs would exceed the gains from the tax cuts they enable, economists said.
""President Trump has sometimes suggested that tariffs could replace income taxes, but no unbiased analyst believes that outcome is remotely possible,"" Fazzari said.
In fiscal year 2024, the federal governmentspent$6.4 trillion while the nation imported $3.3 trillion worth of goods, Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who once worked on the staff of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, haswritten. As a result, he wrote, ""even a 100% tariff on all imported goods would not be enough to finance the federal government, and any tariff on that level would also severely cut imports, dramatically reducing U.S. revenue and inflicting enormous costs on the economy.""
Another problem: Shifting federal revenue generation from taxes to tariffs would be regressive, meaning lower-income Americans would be hit harder than wealthier Americans, Irwin said. That’s because lower-income people spend a larger share of their income on purchases than upper-income people do. In addition, in recent years,about 40%of American households paid no federal income tax, so they wouldn’t see gains from federal income tax cuts. About 60% of non-payers make less than $30,000 and another 28% make between $30,000 and about $60,000, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center found.
Primarily relying on tariffs to generate federal revenue ""is simply substituting a higher and inefficient consumption tax for a lower income tax, and both of those moves are regressive,"" Irwin told PolitiFact.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has argued that Trump’s quick changes on imposing or delaying tariffs serve as a negotiating tool.
""When you’re negotiating with someone and they’re not paying attention and they’re disagreeing, the president, who’s the best dealmaker ever to sit in that chair, he’s going to say, ‘Here’s my response,'"" Lutnicktold CBS News. ""And then all of a sudden, shockingly, they respond.""
If tariffs were simply negotiating tools in order to improve the U.S. position, and weren’t actually imposed, it could boost domestic industrial production and economic growth enough to cut taxes down the road, Irwin said.
However, this is a risky, complicated bet, one that might pay off many years later, after significant economic damage has already occurred, economists said.
Tariffs may be able to boost domestic industrial production, Irwinwrote, but in the modern era, when robots can do many tasks that workers once performed, it doesn’t mean that workers will benefit.
Also, tariffs tend to pick winners and losers. Placing tariffs on products such as steel ""can actually work against the creation of manufacturing jobs,"" Irwin wrote. He citedresearchby economists Kadee Russ and Lydia Cox showing that for every new job created in a U.S. steel mill that benefited from tariff protection, 80 workers in industries that use steel would be hurt. That’s because the companies that use steel will see costs rise and experience smaller sales and a need to cut workers, or both.
Leavitt said, ""Tariffs are a tax cut for the American people.""
Virtually all economists, citing years of data and analysis, characterize tariffs as tax hikes rather than tax cuts, because much of the additional cost of the tariff is passed on to consumers through higher prices.
Seven economists we interviewed said that it’s possible to argue that the added revenue to the treasury from raising tariffs could allow the government to lower taxes. However, analyses show that it’s unlikely that even high tariffs could generate enough revenue to permit meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans.

No evidence that eliminating school choice is on Susan Crawford’s agenda,Madeline Heim,"March 13, 2025","With less than a month until Election Day, the race that will determine the ideological control of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court is full speed ahead.
Liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford and conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, who also served as state attorney general under former Gov. Scott Walker, are blasting each other on issues that are sure to ignite their bases, even though the contest istechnically non-partisan. Crawford’s allies have dogged Schimel onabortion, while Schimel’s have sought to paint Crawford assoft on crime.
As of late, the accusations have also included the topic of school choice.
In aFeb. 6, 2025 post on X, ""Eliminate School Choice"" was one item on a bulleted list of what the Schimel campaign described as Crawford’s ""radical and dangerous"" agenda.
This wasn’t the only time it’s come up. Schimel’s campaign Facebook pageposted Jan. 26, ""If Susan Crawford wins, school choice doesn’t stand a chance.""
Proponents of school choice generally support making public funds available for students to attend private schools. Wisconsin has fourschool voucher programs— in Milwaukee, in Racine, a statewide program and a program forstudents with disabilities— which use tax-funded vouchers to cover the cost of tuition for students at private schools. The students are typically from lower- and middle-income families.
The number of Wisconsin students who are enrolled in voucher programshas been on the rise for years.Close to 55,000were enrolled during the 2023-’24 school year, according to the state Department of Public Instruction.
Public opinion polling on school choice is limited, but in aJune 2024 Marquette University Law School poll, 42% of respondents nationwide said school choice as an education policy has been a complete success or mostly a success, while 25% said it was a complete failure or mostly a failure.
Although school choice has historically been a thorny issue in Wisconsin, it hasn’t been a key point in this race, and there’s also not a case about it before the Supreme Court right now. That made us at PolitiFact Wisconsin wonder where the Schimel claim was coming from.
Is eliminating school choice on Crawford’s agenda if she’s elected to the state’s highest court? Let’s take a look at the facts.
Schimel’s campaign pointed us to three pieces of evidence for the claim:
First, that Crawfordis endorsed by the Wisconsin Education Association Council, which represents the state’s public school teachers — and subsequently that WEACsupporteda 2023 lawsuitfunded by the liberal Minocqua Brewing Super PAC seeking to eliminate funding for Wisconsin’s taxpayer-funded school voucher programs and independent charter schools.
Second, that shewon a lawsuit in 2016that protected the powers of the state superintendent of public instruction (which at the time was Tony Evers, who, of course, is now governor) and blocked then-Gov. Walker and the Legislature from having more of a say in education policy. Crawford was working as an attorney for Madison-based law firm Pines Bach at the time.
And third, that Crawford has called current Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofskya mentor, and Karofskydissented on a 2020 court rulingthat found Dane County health officials could not prohibit private schools from holding in-person classes during the pandemic.
The third point is a stretch no matter how you slice it. It doesn’t include any actions or words from Crawford on schools. So we’ll set that aside.
The other two are certainly indicators that Crawford is a supporter of public schools.
It’d be hard to earn the WEAC endorsement without being one. (A WEAC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about whether the decision to endorse Crawford involved her personal views on school choice.)
And in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story covering her successful 2016 lawsuit, Crawford isquoted as saying, ""This is an important victory for public education … this (Walker) administration has clearly had a goal of privatizing education to a large degree and that’s certainly run counter to the superintendent’s (Evers) mission.""
She also wasamong the attorneys who sued seeking to overturn the Walker-led Act 10, which effectively ended collective bargaining for Wisconsin public employee unions, including those of public school teachers.
But litigating on behalf of public schools is not proof that Crawford plans to attack Wisconsin’s school choice program from the bench, nor that she has specified it as part of an agenda. The evidence Schimel’s team provided does not include any personal opinions Crawford has expressed or rulings she has made from the bench specifically about school choice.
Searches of Crawford’s past public statements and work in private practice and as a circuit court judge did not unearth anything specifically related to school choice.
Crawford spokesperson Derrick Honeyman confirmed as much in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin: ""In her career, Judge Crawford has never taken any position on this issue or suggested the elimination of school choice programs.""
For what it’s worth, it’s not clear that Crawford would get the chance to weigh in on school choice if elected. In December 2023, the Supreme Court — already liberal-controlled at the time —unanimously declinedto hear the Minocqua Brewing Super PAC lawsuit that sought to eliminate funding for voucher programs and charter schools. The suit could still be introduced in a lower court, but it hasn’t been.
Schimel’s campaign said ""eliminate school choice"" is on Crawford’s agenda.
At PolitiFact,the burden is on the speakerto prove that a claim is accurate. The evidence offered here does not do so, and outside evidence to support the claim was not found.
We rate this claim False.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/mar/13/brad-schimel/no-evidence-that-eliminating-school-choice-is-on-s/
"Did the cost of buying a home double under Joe Biden, as JD Vance said?",Louis Jacobson,"March 12, 2025","In a speech to the National League of Cities, Vice President JD Vance said home costs got out of control under former President Joe Biden.
""Under the previous administration, I’ll get a little bit political, the cost of a median-price home in America more than doubled, and that was just in four years,"" VancesaidMarch 10.
When we asked Vance’s staff where this statistic came from, they pointed us to aMay 2024 blog postby the conservative Heritage Foundation that said, ""In roughly three years, the cost of a median price home has more than doubled, increasing 114.5% since Biden took office.""
The Heritage Foundation article didn’t cite a source for that figure, which is far higher than the home price increases recorded by four government and private-sector metrics. But when rising mortgage rates are factored in, we found Vance’s statement is accurate.
EJ Antoni, one of the Heritage article’s co-authors, told PolitiFact that historically, interest rates and home prices have moved in opposite directions, with the fluctuations tending to cancel out.
But during the Biden administration, ""The sharp rise in both home prices and interest rates caused the cost of homeownership to rise very quickly from a historical perspective,"" he said, adding that ""a monthly mortgage payment is what has to fit in a family’s budget, not the selling price of the home.""
It’s important to distinguish between home prices, which is the most commonly tracked metric, and all financial aspects of a home purchase, experts said.
For home prices alone, we found four metrics. Each uses a distinct methodology, and some are better at capturing certain aspects of the housing market than others. But results for all four broadly aligned — and none showed house prices doubling.
FederalDepartment of Housing and Urban Developmentfiguresshowthat from the first quarter of 2021, when Biden took office, to the fourth quarter of 2024, when Biden’s presidency was almost done, the median home sales price rose from $355,000 to $419,200, an 18% increase.
S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Indexfiguresshowa 37% increase on Biden’s watch.
TheZillow Home Value Index, calculated by the online real estate site,shows home values rose under Biden from $267,985 to $355,327, a 33% increase.
Finally, the National Association of Realtors produces an index for existing home sales. Under Biden, the median single-family home sales pricerosefrom $311,900 to $409,300, a 31% increase. The median for all home sales, not just single-family homes, rose by a similar amount, the association said.
Donald R. Haurin, an Ohio State University emeritus economics professor, told PolitiFact he checked thefederal data setand couldn’t find a zip code where prices doubled. He also looked at an independent tracker forthe 50 markets with the most dramatic house price increasesand found the largest increase in any market was 82.8%, in Edwards, Colorado, a resort area with a population of a little over 11,000 people.
However, there’s a more holistic way to look at the cost of buying a home than sales price alone.
This measures what academics sometimes call ""user cost"" — what most homebuyers actually spend when purchasing a home. This includes mortgage interest payments, the foregone earnings of a down payment, property taxes and maintenance.
Haurin did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and found that, using this measurement, the cost of buying a home roughly doubled during Biden’s tenure.
The main additional variable in this calculation is themortgage rate, which was low in January 2021 (about 2.7%) and high in December 2024 (about 6.7%). Using the home prices and the prevailing mortgage rates, this calculation roughly doubles the costs, Haurin said.
Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, co-director of the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia University, agreed with Haurin’s estimate.
""The user cost of owning a home has gone up a lot more than the price of houses,"" Van Nieuwerburgh said.
One caveat: Not every home buyer has a mortgage. The percentage of buyers who arepurchasing homes for cashis at a decade-long high, at 32%. The rate is lower for primary residences (19%) and higher for vacation homes and investment purchases. Still, a large majority of buyers do have to factor in a mortgage.
Vance said, ""Under the previous administration … the cost of a median-price home in America more than doubled, and that was just in four years.""
According to four government and private-sector metrics, home sales prices alone didn’t double under Biden.
However, if you factor in associated costs, most notably fast-rising mortgage rates, the price tag doubled on Biden’s watch.
Vance’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. That’s our definition of Mostly True.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/mar/12/jd-vance/did-the-cost-of-buying-a-home-double-under-joe-bid/
Sen. Rick Scott wrong that full-time jobs dropped under former President Joe Biden,Louis Jacobson,"March 11, 2025","Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., blamed recent economic turbulence — a falling stock market, declining consumer confidence and uncertainty from on-again, off-again tariffs — on President Donald Trump’s predecessor.
On CNN’s ""State of the Union"" on March 9, host Jake TapperaskedScott, ""President Trump has acknowledged that there's going to be a little disturbance due to his economic policies. How bad is this disturbance going to be and how long is it going to last?""
Scott responded, ""Well, first off, Donald Trump walked in with a crappy economy. The number of full-time jobs has been dropping almost the entire Biden administration.""
Scott is wrong about the full-time employment trends under Biden. Full-time jobs increased during Biden’s tenure. Part-time jobs increased, too, driven by people who wanted to work part-time.
Scott’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.
When it comes tofull-time employment, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the number of jobs rose from 125.2 million in January 2021, Biden’s first month in office, to 133.5 million in December 2024, his final full month in office. That’s an increase of 8.3 million jobs, or about 6.6%, over four years.
An alternate way of examining the data is to start counting in June 2022, when the U.S. returned to its prepandemic employment level. This doesn’t include employees who returned to jobs once pandemic conditions improved.
Starting the count in June 2022 still shows an increase, though a more modest one: 998,000 jobs, or about 0.8%.

Part-time jobs also rose during Biden’s tenure.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks two part-time jobs statistics: one foroverall numbersand another that counts part-time jobs ""for economic reasons."" The latter categorycountspeople who are working part-time because of ""unfavorable business conditions, inability to find full-time work, and seasonal declines in demand."" People in this category have told survey-takers that they prefer full-time work and would be available to take it.
A rise in the number of people working part-time for economic reasons is considered worrisome for the economy, but a rise in people working part-time for noneconomic reasons isn’t.
That’s because many of these people are working part-time by choice. In many cases, they are students, parents of young children, retirees or people seeking a certain lifestyle.
""In my research, we consistently find that the voluntary part-time workers report higher health, happiness with work and satisfaction with work schedules than both full-time workers and people working part-time for economic reasons,"" Lonnie Golden, a Penn State University economist,told PolitiFactlast year. ""That's a good thing.""
Under Biden, the growth in part-time work was driven by people working part-time by choice, not because they couldn’t find full-time jobs.
The number of Americans working part-time for economic reasons accounts for a small fraction of all part-time workers, and the share of all part-time workers compared with all workers is also small. Regardless, these shares declined over the course of Biden’s term.

Scott said, ""The number of full-time jobs has been dropping almost the entire Biden administration.""
Whether counting from the beginning of Biden’s term or from June 2022, when U.S. employment returned to its prepandemic level, full time jobs increased on Biden’s watch.
Part-time jobs also increased, largely driven by an increase in the number of workers who chose part-time work because they preferred it to full-time work, not because they tried and failed to find full-time jobs.

AMarch 7postto its 3.6 million followers said:
2017-2020:
Public sector: 9% of U.S. job growth
Private sector: 91% of U.S. job growth
2021-2024:
Public sector: 31% of U.S. job growth
Private sector: 69% of U.S. job growth
February 2025 job report:
Public sector: 7% of U.S. job growth
Private sector: 93% of U.S. job growth
2017-2020:Public sector: 9% of U.S. job growthPrivate sector: 91% of U.S. job growth2021-2024:Public sector: 31% of U.S. job growthPrivate sector: 69% of U.S. job growthFebruary 2025 job report:Public sector: 7% of U.S. job growthPrivate sector: 93% of U.S. job growth
The 2017 to 2020 numbers coincide with President Donald Trump’s first term and are roughly accurate. But the post significantly exaggerated the government jobs gained under Biden.
We sent a direct message to the End Wokeness account for this article but did not hear back.
Private sector employment can be calculated by subtractinggovernment employmentfromoverall employment, using Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
For Trump’s first term, we calculated the change in employment from January 2017 through February 2020, right before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a substantial impact on employment. Overall, employment rose by almost 6.7 million jobs during that period; 92% were private sector jobs, while 8% were in government. That’s close to what the X post said.
The post’s figures for February 2025 accurately represent the data for one month of Trump’s second term
For Biden, though, the post’s numbers are off base.
We first calculated job growth during Biden’s entire tenure, from January 2021 through December 2024. During that period, jobs grew by 16 million, with 11% of those gains — not 31% — from government jobs, while 89% were from private-sector jobs.
Biden-era government job gains did make up a larger portion of overall job growth beginning in    June 2022, when employment returned to its prepandemic peak. Of about 6.6 million jobs created between then and the end of Biden’s term, 22% were in government compared with 78% from the private sector.
There’s a reason for the faster government job growth after that point, said Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. By June 2022, there was a labor shortage, and private employers were able to raise wages faster than governments, because the latter requires legislative action. That enabled private companies to capture more workers quickly. Governments caught up by later in Biden’s term.
An End Wokeness post said that during Biden’s four years in office, ""31% of U.S. job growth"" came from public-sector jobs.
During Biden’s time in office, 11% of job gains were in the public sector.
This represented a slight increase over the growth in public sector jobs during Trump's first term, but was only one-third as high as the post said.

Donald Trump takes credit for military recruitment turnaround that started with Joe Biden,Amy Sherman,"March 11, 2025","President Donald Trump said military recruitment is soaring early in his second presidency, and it’s because of his efforts to rid the government of ""wokeness.""
""Our service members won't be activists and ideologues,"" Trump said in his March 4speechto Congress. ""They will be fighters and warriors,"" he said, praising Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as not being ""big into the woke movement.""
""I'm pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years, and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services,"" Trump said. ""What a difference. And you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere.
""We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround.""
Several readers asked us bytextand email after the speech whether Trump’s claim is true.
Recruitment is up, but it’s been going up for months, well before Trump took office Jan. 20. Military experts said it’s too early to say how Trump has or hasn’t influenced military recruitment just six weeks into his term. Various factors have a bigger influence on recruitment, including the civilian economy and military recruitment programs.
The recruitment process takes weeks from first contact to enlistment, said David Segal, a University of Maryland sociology professor and expert on military recruitment.
""The peak in Army recruiting was in late August 2024 — months before the election,"" Segal said. ""In short, Trump shouldn't get credit for processes that preceded his election.""
RELATED:Fact-checking President Donald Trump’s speech to Congress
The U.S. armed forces has six branches: Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Navy and Space Force.
The Defense Departmentsaidin October that recruitment rose from 200,000 in fiscal year 2022-23, to 225,000 in fiscal year 2023-24 — a 12.5% increase while President Joe Biden was still in office.
Federal fiscal years begin Oct. 1 and end Sept. 30; fiscal year 2025 began under Biden, on Oct. 1, 2024.
The Defense Department released fiscal 2025recruitment data,for October through December, months in which Trump was not commander in chief. It shows that the military is on track to meet or exceed its recruitment goals.
When we asked the White House for evidence to support Trump’s claim, a spokesperson sent us a Feb. 4X postby the U.S. Army that said the branch had its ""most productive December in 15 years by enlisting 346 Soldiers daily.""
Hegsethposteda similar statement that day: ""In December 2024, the @USArmy had its best recruiting number in 12 years. In January 2025, the Army hit its best recruiting number in 15 YEARS.""
We could not confirm Hegseth’s statement about January data, nor could we confirm either month was a 12- or 15-year record. The most recentmonthly cumulative dataon the Defense Department’s website is fromDecember, and the data goes back to 2016. December data showed that the Army reached about109% of its goal.
We asked the Army press office to send us evidence showing January data, but the office sent us alinkto Army recruiting data through fiscal year 2024, which ended Sept. 30, 2024.
Christine Wormuth, Biden’s Army secretary wholeftin January, told PolitiFact that the Armytooknew steps in fall 2023 to professionalize its recruitment workforce and expand its focus beyond high school graduates.
In 2022, the Army launched a ""future soldier"" prep course to help recruits meet fitness or academic standards.
""As early as February 2024 we started seeing much higher numbers than what we had been seeing in 2023,"" Wormuth said.
In 2024, about 25% of new recruits took the course. In 2023, theNavy launched its own prep course.
Wormuth toldFox Newsin February that many of the recruits were women.
""Right now, 16% of the overall Army is women,"" Wormuth said. ""And so, having a year where almost 20% of the new recruits are women is a notable increase.""
She added that 2024 was the highest ever Hispanic recruitment year.
The Army also received training from corporate industry leaders on talent acquisition and revived the 1980s branding campaign ""Be All That You Can Be,"" Fox Newsreported.
Days before Trump took office, Wormuth toldThe Associated Pressthat the Army was on pace to bring in 61,000 young people by the end of the fiscal year in September, which would be the second straight year of meeting recruitment goals.
TheNavy,Coast Guard,Marines,Air ForceandSpace Forcesaid in fall that they met or exceeded recruitment goals for fiscal year 2024.
TheNavy’s 2024 effort marked ""its most significant recruiting achievement in 20 years,"" the branch said. The trend continued during the first four months of the 2025 fiscal year, the branchsaid in February.
The Coast Guardsaidin September it was the first time it met its recruitment goal since 2017.
The Marine Corps Recruiting Command told PolitiFact that recruiters outperformed the first five months of fiscal year 2025 when compared with the same timeframe the previous year.
The biggest driver of enlistments is the civilian economy, said Peter Feaver, Duke University professor and former member of the National Security Council during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.
""When jobs are plentiful on the outside, as was the case late in the Biden years, recruitment gets more difficult,"" Feaver said.
Peter Mansoor, a retired Army colonel, wrote in a Januaryarticlefor the Hoover Institution at Stanford University that since the inception of the all-volunteer military in 1973, recruitment has risen and fallen in conjunction with civilian employment.
""When economic activity dipped, young men and women could find employment at decent wages by joining the armed services,"" Mansoor wrote. But in recent years, ""America’s strong economy has disincentivized enlistment in the armed forces.""
As the Defense Department touted its improved numbers in December,it saidconcerns remained ""about the overall recruiting environment.""
Trump has faulted efforts to expanddiversity, equity or inclusionand LGBTQ+ friendly policies as affecting recruitment. In his first month, hereinstated the transgender military banandrevoked DEIefforts across the federal government.
Republicans have linked ""wokeism"" to military recruitment woes, blaming Pentagon policies on diversity training, time off and travel allowances for abortion access, and health care coverage for transgender members. But military experts said factorsother than ""wokeness""are to blame.
Young Americans have fewer ties to friends or family members who have served in the military, Katie Helland, a military official who works on recruitment,saidin October.
Another factor is that about 77% of people ages 17 to 24 require a waiver to serve because of disqualifications.
It’s possible some American youth are more motivated to serve under Trump, but there is no definitive survey data showing the new administration is driving this enlistment trend, saidKatherine Kuzminski,director of the Center for a New American Security’s military, veterans, and society program.
Center for a New American Security’s survey data has shown ""that perceptions of social policy in the military are more likely to change the preferences of influencers and not actual enlistees,"" Kuzminski said. (Influencersin this context include parents, grandparents, teachers, coaches and clergy.)
Long-standing federal datashows the leading factors keeping young people from the military are fear of physical injury or death (62%), possibility of PTSD (58%), and relocating far away from family (54%).
The main drivers for military service include pay (51%) and educational benefits (44%).
Trump said, ""All armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever"" because of Trump policies, and ""it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite.""
Trump is wrong that the enlistment trend months ago was ""exactly the opposite"" of a recent upswing. Military recruitment rose during the most recent fiscal year, while Biden was president, and continued during his final months in office.
Record recruitment numbers for January and February are plausible, based on trends from several months. Neither the military nor Trump administration officials provided data.
Survey responses show the largest detractors for joining the military are fear of injury or death, the possibility of post-traumatic stress disorder and relocating away from family — not the DEI and LGBTQ+ friendly policies that Trump and Republicans often cite.
We rate this statement Mostly False.

Did court candidate Schimel not join 71 Wisconsin counties in suing Purdue Pharma?,Hope Karnopp,"March 11, 2025","There are many issues that have dominated conversation in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court election — Act 10, voter ID, abortion laws and the candidates’ handling of past criminal cases.
But there’s a topic that has rarely come up that’s the subject of a Facebook ad from A Better Wisconsin Together, a liberal group that hasrun adscritical of Brad Schimel, the conservative candidate in the race.
""71 out of 72 Wisconsin counties filed lawsuits against Purdue Pharma. Brad Schimel refused to join them,"" the ad states.
That refers to litigation launchedaround 2017in Wisconsin and nationwide that sought to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for the opioid crisis.
The ad began running on Feb. 24, 2025, according toMeta’s Ad Library. Meta’s data indicates the ad has been seen at least half a million times.
The ad caught PolitiFact Wisconsin’s attention, because we haven’t seen many mentions of the opioid epidemic in the Supreme Court race.
And money from lawsuit settlements is expected to flow to Wisconsin through 2038.In recent months, $21 million has gone to treatment and recovery programs, the overdose-reversing drug Narcan and more.
So, as the April 1 election approaches, let’s look at Schimel’s involvement on the issue and whether the claim is correct.
On first glance, a voter may assume the ad refers to Schimel’s time as Waukesha County’s district attorney. Was Waukesha the only county that didn’t join the litigation?
But the ad isn’t referencing Schimel’s time working at the county level, said Mike Browne, deputy director for A Better Wisconsin Together.
Rather, it refers to Schimel’s decision not to sue Purdue Pharma and others asstate attorney general, a position he held from 2015 to 2019. He wascounty DAbetween 2006 and 2015.
Let’s back up, because the timeline is important here. In 2017, many counties, cities, towns and tribes filed lawsuits against opioid manufacturers. Many Wisconsin countiesfiled in November of that year.
About 200 pending cases were eventuallyconsolidatedin federal court in Ohio in December 2017.
If a voter remembers that rough timeline, it makes sense that the ad is referring to Schimel choosing to not sue on behalf of Wisconsin and join the counties in that effort.
But that’s a pretty long time ago for the average voter to remember, and the ad does make it sound like he was the only one out of step at the county level.
As an aside, Waukesha was one of the 71 counties that sued Purdue Pharma. Polk County in northwestern Wisconsin was the one county that did not, according to aWPR report.
PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Schimel’s campaign, and they sent back a statement from Schimel’s former chief deputy attorney general and senior counsel, Paul Connell.
Under Schimel, the Department of Justice ""worked in a bipartisan coalition with dozens of other state attorneys general investigating Purdue Pharma, other opioid manufacturers and the primary opioid distributors,"" Connell said.
""Susan Crawford and her allies misunderstand how attorneys general operate when they work across party lines in a complex multi-state context,"" he added.
In the past, Schimel has argued a lawsuit would be a longer, less effective way of getting financial settlements from companies to people in the state, theCap Times reported.
He preferred Wisconsin’s involvement in a multi-state investigation, which also began in 2017. At one time,41 state attorneys generalwere in the group, so Schimel wasn’t an outlier there.
Schimel argued counties would have to use part of the settlement money for private attorney fees, while Wisconsin could get a larger payout if the investigation resulted in a settlement.
Even Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a leader of the investigation and now a rising Democratic figure,saidworking as a coalition would be more effective than taking legal action as individual states.
Membership declined when some attorneys general left the investigation to file lawsuits, including Shapiro, who said Purdue Pharma was not working in good faith on a settlement, according to aCBS News report.
Schimel was not one of them. But Wisconsindid file a lawsuitagainst Purdue Pharma in 2019 after Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, took office afternarrowly defeatingSchimel.
Connell, Schimel’s deputy, said evidence uncovered in the investigation was used by Kaul to file the lawsuit.
Finally, the ad also claims Purdue Pharma’s PAC donated to Schimel during his run for reelection in 2018, and gave money to a Republican group, which then donated nearly $3 million to Schimel.
Analyzing those donations is beyond the scope of this fact-check, but a quick look atcampaign finance recordsshow the PAC donated $250 directly to Schimel in November 2016.
Schimelhas saidpreviously he did not know he received a donation from Purdue Pharma until he read about it in the newspaper.
An ad from A Better Wisconsin Together claims state Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel did not join in when ""71 out of 72 Wisconsin counties filed lawsuits against Purdue Pharma.""
Waukesha County, where Schimel was a district attorney and now a judge, was involved in that lawsuit. By 2017, Schimel was state attorney general, but that’s a hard detail for the average voter to recall.
Other claims about campaign donations make clear the ad is talking about Schimel as attorney general. Still, the ad is misleading if voters read it as Schimel being the odd one out at the county level.
But that’s not the case. And the ad doesn’t mention Schimel’s decision to join a multi-state investigation, which many attorneys general did initially. He ultimately didn’t sue, like other states did.
Our definition of Half True is ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/mar/11/better-wisconsin-together/did-court-candidate-schimel-not-join-71-wisconsin/

Trump was speaking in the Oval Office March 7 alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino as they announceda White House task forcethat will oversee preparations for the 2025 Club World Cup and the 2026 World Cup.
The U.S. in June will host theClub World Cup, a 32-teamtournamentin which top professional teams compete. And in the summer of 2026, the U.S., Canada and Mexico will host theWorld Cup tournament, in which 48 national teams compete. The three nations in 2018 won a joint bid to host the international soccer event across 16 North American cities.
Trump was referring to thatsuccessful 2018 bidwhen he made the Oval Office remarks featured in these social media claims. Trump didn’t say the 2024 election was rigged in his favor. He was talking about the 2020 presidential election that he lost; he has repeatedly andfalselyclaimed it was ""rigged"" against him.
(C-SPAN video)
In the full, originalvideo, it’s clear that Trump was noting that he wouldn’t have been president during the 2026 World Cup if he had won in 2020. His comments came in response to Infantino’s remarks about the logistics of coordinating a massive event that involves selling 10 million tickets. Starting at the 2:46 mark, Trump said:
""I love what he said, like three Super Bowls a day for a month. That's what it is. That's really amazing when you think of it. I've never heard that expression. That's a lot. When, you know, when we made this, it was made during my term, my first term,and it was so sad, because I said, ‘Can you imagine, I'm not going to be president, and that's too bad.’ And what happened is, they rigged the election, and I became president.

"No hay una orden ejecutiva diciendo que 47,000 cubanos serán deportados de EEUU",Maria Briceño,"Marzo 10, 2025","¿Es cierto que una orden ejecutiva del presidente Donald Trump dice que 47,000 cubanos legalmente en EE.UU. serán deportados?
Una publicación en Facebook del 20 de febrero muestra imágenes de cubanos protestando en EE.UU. y de personas siendo arrestadas.
""Nueva orden ejecutiva desde la Casa Blanca tiene identificado a más de 47,000 cubanos con residencia legal, los cuales serán puestos en proceso de deportación por haber viajado a Cuba después de su aprobación de asilo político"",diceel video.

La publicación fue marcada como parte del esfuerzo de Meta para combatir las noticias falsas y la desinformación en su plataforma. (Lea más sobrenuestra colaboración con Meta, propietaria de Facebook, Instagram y Threads).
El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS, por sus siglas en inglés)dijoen Xque casi 13,000 personas fueron deportadas en las primeras dos semanas de la administración del presidente Donald Trump. La administración no especificó si entre ellos había cubanos.
PolitiFact no encontró evidencia de que exista una orden para deportar a cubanos con residencia permanente.
En la página oficial de la Casa Blanca, no haycomunicadoso unaorden ejecutivasobre la deportación de 47,000 cubanos. Tampoco hay reportes en la página web delDepartamento de Seguridad Nacional, o delServicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas de Estados Unidos(ICE, por sus siglas en inglés).
Un experto en leyes de inmigración, Ira J. Kurzban, le dijo a PolitiFact que él desconoce el origen de la cifra en la publicación en Facebook.
Un abogado de inmigración, Santiago Alpizar, dijo en unaentrevistael 12 de febrero conelTOQUE, una plataforma multimedia que informa sobre Cuba, que es falso que 40,000 cubanos detenidos por ICE están siendo deportados.
Él dijo que ese número es un total histórico de cubanos que han recibido órdenes de deportación durante muchos años por diferentes razones. Alpizar dijo que ellos históricamente no han sido deportados por falta de un convenio de deportación entre Estados Unidos y Cuba.
Los vuelos de deportación entre EE.UU. y Cuba estuvieron en pausa hasta abril de 2023, cuando sereanudaronprincipalmente para las personas que fueron detenidas por entrar ilegalmente recientemente por la frontera sur de EE.UU.
El 27 de febrero, Cuba recibió un vuelo de deportación de EE.UU. de 104 ""migrantes irregulares"" como parte de acuerdos migratorios bilaterales,segúnla página oficial del Ministerio del Interior de la República de Cuba.
Debido a lassancionesde EE.UU. a Cuba, residentes permanentes pueden viajar a Cuba sólo por 12 razones específicas que deben ser aprobadas por el gobierno de EE.UU. Estas incluyen visitas a la familia e investigaciones profesionales o periodísticas. El turismo no es una de las razones aprobadas.
Además, Kurzban dijo que la mayoría de cubanos no han obtenido su residencia a través de asilo político, sino a través de la Ley de Ajuste Cubano de 1966. Esta ley permite que cubanos que viven en Estados Unidos soliciten la residencia permanente si cumplen ciertos requisitos.
Jose Guerrero, un abogado de inmigración, nos dijo que no es recomendable para asilados viajar a su país.
""Si le dieron asilo y usted viaja al país de donde dijo que lo persiguen y que su vida corría peligro, entonces lo pueden investigar y podría perder la residencia"", dijo Guerrero.
El Servicio de Ciudadanía e Inmigración de Estados Unidos (USCIS, por sus siglas en inglés)diceque aunque se puede viajar a su país de origen, el gobierno estadounidense puede terminar su asilo si se determinan ciertos factores. Por ejemplo, si se determina que se acogió voluntariamente a la protección de su país de nacionalidad, adquirió una nueva nacionalidad, o que ya no reúne las condiciones para asilo debido a cambios fundamentales en sus circunstancias.
Rick Su, un profesor de ley de inmigración en la Universidad de Carolina del Norte, Chapel Hill, también dijo que no existe una ley que dicte una deportación automática por viajar al país de origen después de recibir asilo.
Kurzban dijo que antes de deportar a un residente o quitarle su residencia, se tendría que pasar por un proceso en el que un juez examine el caso.
Una publicación en Facebook dice que una ""nueva orden ejecutiva desde la Casa Blanca tiene identificado a más de 47,000 cubanos con residencia legal los cuales serán puestos en proceso de deportación por haber viajado a Cuba después de su aprobación de asilo político"".
No hay evidencia de esto.
PolitiFact no encontró ninguna orden ejecutiva diciendo que deportaran a esa cantidad de residentes permanentes cubanos.

As ofMarch 10, the commission reported 14 fires burned across 2,931 acres. One, the Covington Drive fire, remained active and the rest were described as contained.
But there’s no evidence showing the South Carolina wildfires are connected to Myrtle Beach officials’ discussions about creating a ""smart city.""
First, the wildfires aren’t in the city of Myrtle Beach, a vacation destination with apopulationof about 40,000. The fire started on Covington Drive, a street in the Covington Lakes subdivision that runs alongside Carolina Forest, which is in an unincorporated area about 10 miles outside of Myrtle Beach city limits. The Myrtle Beach Fire Department isassisting in the response.
The South Carolina Forestry Commission arrested Alexandra Bialousow, 40, whois facingcharges related to the Covington Drive blaze after investigators said she started a fire to burn debris in her backyard. She is accused of negligently allowing fire to spread.
""Witnesses reported seeing Bialousow intentionally start a fire in a backyard fire pit that was in close proximity to a tree line within Covington Lakes Subdivision on March 1,"" the commissionsaidin a press release. ""According to the arrest warrant, the suspect ‘did not have an appropriate water source readily available,’ nor did she ‘have any garden tools on hand to control the fire.’""

The city is developing what it calls a ""living lab,"" apublic-private partnershipthat aims to make Myrtle Beach a development hub for technology entrepreneurs. But Meredith Denari, a City of Myrtle Beach spokesperson, told PolitiFact the plans would not require any citywide infrastructure changes. She said the city plans to build the lab in its downtown Arts & Innovation District.
""There are no fires currently in this area nor anywhere in city limits,"" Denari said in an email. ""All sites being considered for the city’s future living lab are already under city ownership.""

It’s not unusual for government agencies to purchase advertising time on NBCUniversal networks. The NIH, for example, ran a commercial in January and February 2020 seeking clinical research volunteers.

Is Elon Musk’s DOGE 'very popular'? That’s not what the polls say,Louis Jacobson,"March 6, 2025","As Fox News viewers waited to hear President Donald Trump begin his address to a joint session of Congress, commentator Larry Kudlow mused about what role Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency would play in Trump’s speech.
""I wonder out loud how much DOGE budget cutting will be in this speech, because actually it’s polling very well,"" KudlowsaidMarch 4. ""It’s very popular."" Kudlow served as director of the National Economic Council during Trump’s first presidency.
DOGE — the Trump administration’s cost-cutting agency, headed by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk — has put hundreds of federal workerson leave, gained access to sensitive federalpayment systemsand sought toshutter some federal agencies. Trump created the agency by executive order, and it’s part of the executive branch.
Is DOGE as popular as Kudlow said?
In a statement to PolitiFact provided through Fox News, Kudlow said he was referring to aHarvard-Harris poll taken on Feb. 19 and 20. The poll showed people believe DOGE is making major government cuts, but it didn’t measure sentiment about those cuts. Respondents reported they are concerned about the group’s access to sensitive information.
Meanwhile, at least six other polls conducted since mid-February show less support for DOGE. Two polls found public ambivalence about DOGE, and four showed opposition outpacing support. We did not find polls that showed overwhelming support for DOGE.
The Harvard-Harris poll did not directly ask respondents whether they supported or approved of DOGE.
In one question, they were asked, ""Do you think there should be a U.S. government agency focused on efficiency initiatives, or not?"" Seventy-two percent said yes and 24% said no. But the question didn’t specifically reference DOGE.
In another question, respondents were asked whether DOGE ""is helping make major cuts in government expenditures, or not?"" Sixty percent said it’s making major cuts, and 40% said it isn’t. But this question did not measure respondents’ feelings about perceived cuts.
Answers to the poll’s other questions suggested the respondents had concerns about DOGE.
When asked, ""Do you think that DOGE employees should have access to all information on government expenditures,"" including Americans’ names, Social Security numbers, addresses and incomes, 58% said DOGE should not have such access.
And when asked whether the executive branch or Congress should control how the U.S. government spends its money, 58% said Congress.
ACBS News/YouGov polltaken Feb. 26 to 28 showed split sentiments. When asked what they think of Trump’s efforts to cut staff at government agencies, 51% said they approve and 49% said they disapprove.
A slight majority — 52% — said Musk and DOGE have too much authority to cut the federal workforce, while 33% said Musk and DOGE have the right amount of authority and 15% said too little. And on the question of access to sensitive data, 52% said DOGE had too much access.
AnEconomist/YouGov pollfrom Feb. 23 to 25 also found public sentiment to be split.
When asked about the Trump administration's efforts to reduce federal agencies' budgets and staff, 43% said the efforts have ""gone too far."" That was a plurality, but it was neck and neck with the combination of people answering ""been about right"" and ""not gone far enough.""
This poll, too, had responses that offered warning signs about support for DOGE.
When respondents were asked, ""How much influence do you want Elon Musk to have within Donald Trump’s administration,"" 16% said ""a lot,"" 24% said ""a little"" and a plurality of 45% said ""none at all."" And 57% said they were very or somewhat concerned that Musk would have conflicts of interest.
AWashington Post-Ipsos polltaken from Feb. 13 to 18 asked respondents whether they approve or disapprove of the job Elon Musk is doing within the federal government. It found 34% approval and 49% disapproval. The survey also found concern about DOGE’s access to sensitive information; 63% of respondents said they were concerned, with 45% saying they were ""very concerned.""
When aQuinnipiac polltaken Feb. 13 to 17 asked whether respondents approve or disapprove of Elon Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration, it found 42% approval and 54% disapproval.
Quinnipiac also found 55% of respondents saying Musk has too much power, 36% saying his power is about right and 3% saying he had too little power.
AnEmerson College polltaken from Feb. 15 to 17 asked respondents whether they approved or disapproved of ""the job Elon Musk is doing at the Department of Government Efficiency."" It found that 45% disapproved and 41% approved.
Finally, aMarist Poll for NPR and PBStaken fromFeb. 24 to 26 asked respondents whether they had a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of DOGE. The results were 39% favorable and 44% unfavorable.
Regardless of the poll, one group consistently showed support for DOGE and Musk: Republicans.
Typically, 70% to 85% of Republicans answered favorably to questions about what Musk and DOGE are doing, while less than 20% of Democrats answered similarly.
Kudlow said that DOGE is ""polling very well. It’s very popular.""
A Harvard-Harris survey found 72% said the U.S. should have a ""government agency focused on efficiency initiatives,"" but the question didn’t ask specifically about DOGE. And the poll found 60% saying DOGE is helping make major cuts, but did not measure support for those cuts.
In six other polls, none showed overwhelming support for DOGE’s efforts. Four showed DOGE to be unpopular; two showed split public sentiment.
There’s an element of truth in Kudlow’s statement — based on party affiliation, Republicans surveyed largely saw DOGE and Musk favorably. But that’s not the case for the broader set of respondents.

That coalition included Rewiring America and four other groups thatcame together in 2023to apply for $9.5 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy funding.
After what it described as a ""robust"" review process, the EPAawardedthe grant under then-President Joe Biden.
Power Forward Communitiessaid Feb. 24it was beginning work on several projects including energy efficiency upgrades in Clinton, Iowa, a new apartment complex in Detroit, Michigan, and home renovations in Salem, Massachusetts.

""Stacey Abrams has not received a penny of this EPA grant,"" Mayopoulos said in the Feb. 24 Politico article. ""It was never the plan for her to receive any money from this grant. Power Forward Communities has no relationship with Ms. Abrams, other than the fact that she’s one of the people who have advised one of our coalition members in the past.""
In October 2023, shortly after Rewiring America announced Power Forward Communities’ creation, Abrams said in anX postshe was ""Thrilled to be part of (Rewiring America) and the Power Forward Communities coalition.""
In an apparent response to the mention in Trump’s March 4 speech, Abrams said she stood by her energy work.
""I’m proud of my work protecting civil rights & lowering energy costs for Georgians,"" AbramswroteMarch 4 on X. ""Someone has to deliver — because Trump is taking our hard-earned money to cut Elon Musk's taxes.""
On CNN March 5,Abrams rebuttedthe idea that she was in charge of the coalition.
""I did not work for the entity that received the grant, ultimately,"" Abrams said. ""I worked for one of the partner organizations, but I was very much a part of pushing and showing America that we have the ability to lower prices.""

A post shared by Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams)
Trump said his administration identified $1.9 billion going to a ""decarbonization of homes"" group that Abrams ""headed up.""
This is inaccurate. From March 2023 through the end of 2024, Abrams was senior counsel for Rewiring America, one of five groups in the Power Forward Communities coalition.
Power Forward Communities was awarded a $2 billion EPA grant, but Abrams did not ""head up"" that group and there’s no evidence she directly received any of the grant money. The coalition’s CEO said Abrams was not paid by Power Forward Communities and did not receive any of the federal funds.

MPS does indeed have a larger tax levy than the City of Milwaukee,D.L. Davis,"March 3, 2025","Milwaukee Public Schools has been making recent headlines as a judge on Feb. 18, 2025, said the school board overseeing MPS and the city of Milwaukee must split the cost of a school police program down the middle and put police in schools with a deadline of Feb. 27, according to a Feb. 19, 2025,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article.
On deadline day, a judge held the city of Milwaukee in contempt of court for failing to comply with his previous order to have school resource officers in Milwaukee Public Schools by Feb. 27.
Milwaukee Circuit Judge David Borowski stayed that order, however, giving the city until March 15 to get the officers in schools or face a $1,000-per-day fine, according to a Feb. 27, 2025,Milwaukee Journal Sentinelnews report.
In the run-up to the earlier court decision, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson discussed his January meeting with GOP legislative leaders at the Capitol during a Jan. 12, 2025, appearance onWISN-12 News ""UpFront""program. Johnson spoke of his support for getting 25 Milwaukee police officers back into Milwaukee Public Schools.
""Well, you have to have the funding in order to get the officers,"" Johnson said. ""When you go to a restaurant and you order a meal, the chef doesn't prepare your meal and then pick up the check. That's what MPS is asking. I think that's wrong for taxpayers in the City of Milwaukee, especially given the fact that presently, right now, after the referendum, Milwaukee Public Schools has a larger tax levy than the City of Milwaukee.""
The deadline is the latest development in a lawsuit seeking to force the MPS school board and city of Milwaukee to comply with a state law known as Act 12. Since Jan. 1, 2024, the law has required the presence of 25 police officers in MPS during school hours, among other things.
In April, Milwaukee voters narrowly approved a referendum that will increase property taxes to prevent major budget cuts at Milwaukee Public Schools, according to an April 3, 2024Milwaukee Journal Sentinelarticle.
The referendum was crafted to allow MPS to gain an additional $140 million for the next school year, then ramp up to $252 million annually by the 2027-28 school year, according to theJournal Sentinelreport. Without the referendum money, MPS projected that it would face a $200 million budget shortfall in the next school year because of rising costs. Those costs include: inflationary raises for staff, filling vacant positions and retaining staff who were funded by sunsetting pandemic-relief aid.
The mayor’s claim that Milwaukee Public Schools has a larger tax levy than the City of Milwaukee after the referendum, piqued the interest of PolitiFact Wisconsin, so let’s take a look.
When asked to support the mayor’s statement, Jeff Fleming, Johnson’s communications director,
expanded on the statement.
""The mayor’s point was, with the school referendum passed last year, MPS has more budgeting flexibility than city government,"" Fleming said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""The statement was not offered as a criticism of MPS.""
A chart prepared by the office of City of Milwaukee Comptroller Bill Christianson shows the total citywide tax levies for 2023 at $855.5 million and 2024 at $963.7 million, an increase of 12.6%.
A breakdown of the citywide tax levies divided into five units of government:
Milwaukee Public Schools $320.2 million in 2023; $414.8 million in 2024, increase of 29.5%
City of Milwaukee $317.7 million in 2023; $324.2 million in 2024, increase of 2.0%
Milwaukee County $132.1 million in 2023; $136.3 million in 2024, increase of 3.2%
Sewerage District $51.8 million in 2023; $53.7 million in 2024, increase of 3.7%
Milwaukee Area Technical College $33.7 million in 2023; $34.7 million in 2024, increase of 3.0%
Breaking it down into a share of a one dollar bill, here’s how much each entity received in 2024:
Milwaukee Public Schools, 43 cents
City of Milwaukee 34 cents
Milwaukee County 14 cents
Sewerage District 5 cents
MATC 4 cents
Andrew Reschovsky, Professor Emeritus of Public Affairs and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in an email, said ""the mayor’s statement is true,"" and attached a table illustrating data that includes property tax revenue of the city government and the Milwaukee Public School District for the years 2000 through 2021.
The data shows that in 2009 and 2010 and again in 2024 and 2025, school property tax revenue (or levies) exceeded city property tax revenues, Reschovsky said in the email.
Johnson said, ""After the referendum, Milwaukee Public Schools has a larger tax levy than the City of Milwaukee.""
Data from the City of Milwaukee Office of the Comptroller shows citywide tax levies divided into five units of government with Milwaukee Public Schools at $320.2 million in 2023; $414.8 million in 2024, an increase of 29.5% and the City of Milwaukee at $317.7 million in 2023; $324.2 million in 2024, an increase of 2.0%.

Stock photos in news reports don’t mean Texas measles outbreak isn’t real,Jeff Cercone,"February 28, 2025","A Threads post said a Texas measles outbreak that has sickened 146 people and killed a child this year as of Feb. 28 isn’t real because media outlets covering the story used stock images in their reports.
""The ‘Texas measles outbreak’ is pure propaganda,"" a Feb. 25Threads postsaid. ""Ever wonder why these news reports never have an actual picture of the ‘outbreak’ or name one person affected? They are making it very easy to realize there is no ‘virus.’""
The post shared four images from news reports inUSA Today,NPR,ABC NewsandFox Newsthat used stock images of people stricken with measles, a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can causeserious complications, including arashwith visible flat, red spots on a victim’s body.
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The Threads post’s assertion that stock image usage is evidence that the outbreak isn’t real misunderstands how photojournalism works. It also ignores the multiple public health departments and officials, including new Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. that have spoken about the outbreak.
(Screenshot from Threads)
The account that shared the Threads post has alsopostednumerous anti-vaccine posts and others that falsely claim viruses don’t exist.
The Texas Department of State Health Services has issuednews releasesand public health alerts since Jan. 23, when itannouncedthat two people in Houston’s Harris County who had traveled internationally were the first confirmed measles cases in Texas since 2023. Texas health officialssaythose two cases are unrelated to the West Texas outbreak, the bulk of which are in Gaines County.
The department on Feb. 26announcedthe outbreak’s first death, a school-aged child who was not vaccinated. Of the 146 Texas measles cases, five were among people vaccinated for measles and the rest among people who were not vaccinated or whose statuses were unknown.
The Centers for Disease Controlsaidas of Feb. 27 there were 164 measles cases in nine states — the agency is updating those totals every Friday. State public health department numbers were slightly higher, with 169 confirmed measles cases in nine states: Texas with 146,New Mexicowith nine,California,GeorgiaandNew Jerseywith three each,New York Citywith two, and one each inAlaska,KentuckyandRhode Island.
Kennedyspoke about the measles outbreakFeb. 26 to reporters at Trump’s first Cabinet meeting. The CDC said the U.S. has had three measles outbreaks this year and 16 in 2024. Kennedy said. ""It’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.""
There were 16 U.S. outbreaks in 2024, with 285 cases across 33 jurisdictions, CDCdata shows. The Texas child’s death was thefirst in the U.S. since 2015. Statedatashowed it came in a county with one of the state’s highest rates of school-aged children who received exemptions from receiving one or more required vaccines for reasons of conscience. About91% of all U.S. childrenhave been vaccinated. The World Health Organization said the viruskilled about 107,500 peopleworldwide in 2023.
That the news outlets used stock images showing unidentifiable children with measles is not unusual, particularly when reporting on health issues in which live photos are rare.
USA Today, ABC News and NPR all used different stock images provided by Getty Images to illustrate stories about measles. It’s not clear where the Fox News images came from, but we found the two stock images seen in the Fox video onotherwebsites.
When patients consent to be identified or photographed, news organizations are more likely to use those images in their coverage. None of the Texas measles victims in Texas have been identified by state officials due to privacy laws. People with measles also would likely be in quarantine at home or being treated in a hospital, not sharing their highly contagious disease with journalists.
Public health and medical websites often usestock photos, olderunidentifiablemedicalphotos, orclip artto illustrate stories about various diseases, rather than photos of currently ill people.
The claim that the use of these images in stories about a current outbreak proves that the outbreak is not real is nonsensical. We rate it Pants on Fire!",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/28/threads-posts/stock-photos-in-news-reports-dont-mean-texas-measl/

"No, a vaccine campaign did not cause the Gaines County, Texas, measles case spike",Loreben Tuquero,"February 28, 2025","In Texas, dozens of children have contracted measles in the state’s largest outbreak in 33 years. Online, some are blaming vaccines for the disease’s spread.
""Measles cases surge 2,042% in Texas County following free vaccine campaign— coincidence or connection?"" read what looked like a headline screenshot featured in aFeb. 19 Facebook post. ""Gaines County, Texas, is experiencing a staggering 2,042% spike in measles cases — right after a public health initiative distributed free measles vaccines.""
Gaines County is experiencing an alarming measles outbreak. And its health officials did launch a vaccine drive. But the post gets its numbers wrong and misleads about the nature of the measles vaccine: It is highly effective, and vaccinated people are far less likely to contract or spread the disease.
(Screenshot from Facebook)
The Facebook post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
The post’s claim originated in aFeb. 17article from The People’s Voice, a websiteknownforspreading misinformation.
""There is no evidence that the measles vaccine can spread to other people. It is not contagious,"" Raul Andino-Pavlovsky, professor of microbiology and immunology at University of California, San Francisco, told PolitiFact.
Measlesis a highly contagious viral infection that can cause fever, rash, coughing, ear infections, pneumonia and death. Itspreadsthrough the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes and is especially transmissible among children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2000, measles wasdeclared eliminatedin the U.S. after more than a year without continuous spread, a development that health officials attributed to ahighly successfulvaccine campaign.
But large measles outbreaks can occur when the virus crosses borders and reaches unvaccinated orundervaccinatedcommunities, theCDC said. Increasingvaccine hesitancyratescontributeto outbreaks.
In late January, Texas reportedtwo measles casesin Houston’s Harris County. The cases involvedtwo peoplein the same household who had traveled internationally and were not vaccinated.
As of Feb. 28, the number of reported infections had increased to155across nine Texas counties andeastern New Mexico, including an unvaccinated school-aged childwho diedafter being treated at a Lubbock, Texas, children’s hospital. Of the 146 Texas-only cases, five people were vaccinated. The rest were either classified as unvaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the Texas Department of State Health Servicessaid.
Gaines County’s case numbers led all the other counties with 98 — not ""200 or 300"" as the Facebook post said — a 1,533% rise from the six cases it reported Feb. 5. On Feb. 14, NBC News said health officials'estimatedthat another 200 to 300 people were infected across West Texas — not Gaines County alone — but haven’t been tested.
""There are people who are in the process of being tested and evaluated for measles in West Texas but there are not 200-300 people waiting on testing at this time,"" Lara Anton, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson, told PolitiFact in a Feb. 27 email. ""We expect that the number of cases will continue to increase because the virus is highly contagious and 90% of unvaccinated people will get it.""
Anton said the department does not provide counts of suspected cases.
Gaines County’s public schoolslast yearhad one of the state’s highest vaccine exemption rates, with more than 17% of its students citing reasons of conscience for not receiving one or more required vaccinations.
The People’s Voice cited South Plains Public Health Districtvaccination clinicsheld Feb. 6 and 7 in Gaines County.  On Feb. 5, the Texas state health departmentconfirmedGaines had six cases of measles, ""all among unvaccinated school-aged children.""
But there is no information that suggests such vaccines would accelerate infection spread — it curbs it. Claims otherwise stem from a misunderstanding of ""vaccine shedding."" The Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is a two-dose attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine.According to the CDC, the virus causes a harmless infection in the vaccinated person’s body that causes very few, if any, symptoms. The immune system responds to the infection and the body develops immunity.
Although it is possible for vaccinated individuals to ""shed"" the virus in their urine and stool, experts told PolitiFact the measles vaccine would not transmit the disease to other people. Antontold NBC Newsthat all samples tested in the outbreak were identified as a known wild measles strain, not a vaccine strain.
Paul Offit, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Vaccine Education Center director, said the measles vaccine virus is ""too attenuated to be passed from one person to the next.""
Matthew Washam, assistant professor at Ohio State University College of Medicine’s Department of Pediatrics and co-writer of a2024 articleabout measles vaccine shedding in children, said vaccines don’t cause outbreaks as the post said.
""This shedding is not contagious to others, and does not lead to measles outbreaks,"" he said.
Live virus vaccines are not recommended for all people.Cancer patients, for example, and others who are immunocompromised may not have the ability to fight the virus, even in the vaccine’s weakened form.
Andino-Pavolvsky said a small number of people who receive the vaccine may develop mild rashes, but they would not be contagious and would pose no risk to others. Philip Keiser, a University of Texas Medical Branch global health professor, told PolitiFact there’s no scientific literature supporting the notion that a vaccine virus shed from someone who is vaccinated would be transmissible.
""The MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella) is the best and most reliable way to protect against these serious diseases,"" Andino-Pavolsky said. ""It has been widely studied and is considered one of the safest and most effective vaccines ever developed.""

Do 90% of Wisconsin school districts ban cellphones during class time?,Hope Karnopp,"February 28, 2025","When the state Legislature kicked off a new session in 2025, one of the first areas of focus for Republicans was education.
Billsrecently passedby the state Assembly — one step toward reaching the governor’s desk — included reversing changes to test score benchmarks and requiring cursive and civics to be taught in schools.
Another bill would require school boards to adopt a policy by July 2026 that prohibits students from using cell phones during instructional time.
At a Feb. 19, 2025,press conferencebefore his bill passed the Assembly, state Rep. Joel Kitchens, a Republican from Sturgeon Bay, said ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy"" like the one the bill requires.
During floor debate on the bill, Democrats argued the bill would take away local control from school boards. Kitchens has pushed back on that idea.
""What we really need here is a unified approach,"" Kitchens said at the press conference. ""We are saying to the school districts that we’re standing with you on this, because everyone agrees this is a problem.""
The 90% figure caught our attention, especially when there’s so much debate over a policy that might already be par for the course in most school districts.
Is it true that the vast majority of Wisconsin school districts already ban cellphones during class time?
Let’s take a look.
PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Kitchens’ office to ask where the 90% number came from. They pointed us to the Department of Public Instruction’stestimonyduring a Feb. 11 public hearing for the bill.
The department referenced its annualDigital Learning Survey. About 320 of the 421 public school districts in Wisconsin participated in the voluntary survey for the 2024-25 school year, officials said.
Approximately 90% of districts that took part in the survey ""already have some sort of restrictive cellphone policy in place,"" according to the department.
Fewer than 10% of districts did not have a cellphone policy and left it up to teachers to decide how to manage cell phone use in their classrooms, the survey found.
While about a quarter of school districts did not participate in the survey, the 75% who did respond still represent the vast majority of districts in Wisconsin.
Cellphone policies ‘vary significantly’ by school district
While the 90% number is solid, it’s quite vague when referring to school districts having ""some sort of restrictive cellphone policy.""
Theresultsof the Digital Learning Survey drills down into that 90% number. Of that 90% total, about 26% of districts allow high school students to use cellphones in common areas but not classrooms.
About 44% of districts apply that policy for middle schoolers, along with high school students. And around 21% of districts have a full cellphone ban at all schools.
In its testimony, DPI noted cellphone policies ""vary significantly.""
""In general, middle and high schools tend to have some form of restriction, while elementary schools usually enforce a ‘no phones during the day’ policy,"" DPI said.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel alsoreported a samplingof districts’ cellphone policies at the beginning of the 2024-25 school year.
Some schools require students to place cellphones in caddies before the start of class. Many districts allow students to use devices outside of class, like during passing time and lunch.
The bill also requires cellphone policies to have exceptions, allowing students to use phones during emergencies and threats, for example, or to manage their health care.
Kitchens, in his owntestimony, said the bill was written ""as open as possible"" and that each district will determine how to best restrict phones and enforce it.
Kitchens said ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy"" that bans cellphones during instructional time.
The Department of Public Instruction cited that 90% figure when testifying about Kitchens’ bill that would require districts to have that policy.
While specific policies vary by district, that 90% figure includes districts that either fully ban cellphones in schools or prohibit them in classrooms.

Why did Kamala Harris get zero votes in this NY precinct? It’s not because of Elon Musk,Jeff Cercone,"February 26, 2025","Did Elon Musk hack the 2024 presidential election in President Donald Trump’s favor?
Such claims were common on social media after the election — PolitiFactrateda claim that Musk used his Starlink satellite internet technology to manipulate votes Pants on Fire.
But the allegation persists a month after Trump took office. Some social media users recently pointed to a November election precinct result in Rockland County, New York, as evidence.
A Feb. 24X postsaid, ""Musk's election hacking prowess is pretty crude, blowing data out in ways they almost seem to want to get caught. Rockland Co, New York: Harris supposedly received ZERO votes in a district that the Dem Senate candidate won by 79%?""
The post shared screenshots of results in precinct 35 in Ramapo, a town of about153,000 peopleabout 30 miles northwest of New York City. Screenshots showed Trump beating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, 552 votes to zero, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., beating Republican opponent Michael Sapraicone, 331-82.
We foundothersocial mediapostsusing the same precinct results toaccuseMusk of hacking the election.
Setting aside the shaky logic of Musk hacking one precinct’s results in a blue state that Harris won bymore than a million votes, it could seem jarring to see the Democratic candidate for president not win a single vote, even in a small precinct.
The screenshots showed accurate vote totals, but the results are not surprising or an example of hacking or fraud, experts told PolitiFact. They’re the result of a town with a large Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish population bloc voting in support of their rabbis’ endorsed candidates.
(Screenshot from X)
""This is not uncommon,"" Republican Jewish Coalition spokesperson Sam Markstein said. ""You can go back several years to presidential elections,"" and see similar results.
A closer look at Rockland County’selection resultsshow precinct 35 in Ramapo was not an aberration. Trump won 55.4% of the Rockland County vote, besting Harris by 17,663 votes.
In Ramapo, Trump won 80 of 122 precincts. Aside from precinct 35, Harris earned zero votes in four other Rockland County precincts: precinct 45 (Trump 90-0), precinct 84 (Trump 558-0), precinct 97 (Trump 494-0) and precinct 122 (Trump 23-0).
In several other precincts, Harris received one or single digit votes, while Trump got hundreds. In precinct 55, for example, Trump outpaced Harris, 986 to 2.
The 2024 Ramapo results mirrored its 2020 presidential vote. That year, Trump bested former President Joe Biden 528-0 in precinct 35. In the 2022 midterm elections, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul lost to her Republican opponent, Lee Zeldin, 408 to 24 in that same precinct, which also overwhelmingly voted to reelect Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., over his Republican opponent, Joe Pinion, 266 to 113.
A screenshot shows certified 2020 presidential election results in Ramapo precinct 35. (Rockland County Board of Elections)
Benjamin Rosenblatt, a New York elections data expert, said precinct 35 is in the village of Kaser, which is composed almost entirely of Hasidic Jews of the Viznitz sect. The village is surrounded by the hamlet of Monsey, which also has a huge Orthodox Jewish community, he said.
Rosenblatt said in Kaser, and other Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities in Rockland County, such as New Square, ""voters often vote as a bloc, to an extreme degree.""
New Square has five voting precincts, including precinct 55, and across the five, voters chose Trump, 3,518 to 13.
The Jewish communities  ""will often vote nearly entirely for one candidate in each race, but may not vote for the same party in every race,"" Rosenblatt said in an email. ""For example, they may vote as a bloc for a Republican for President, but for a Democrat for State Senate or other local races.""
That’s what happened here, as well as in 2020 and in midterm elections, Rosenblatt said.
""These communities are often somewhat conservative, but the rabbis' endorsements play an incredibly large role in the communities' voting patterns, and that includes endorsements for Democrats in many races,"" Rosenblatt said.
An October 2024 Jewish Insider articledescribednational Democratic and Republican party leaders heading to Rockland County to secure Orthodox leaders’ powerful endorsements.
Ira Sheskin, a University of Miami professor who tracks the Jewish population in the U.S., said his data shows in 2023 Rockland County had 109,900 total Jewish residents. U.S. Census datashowsthere were 340,807 total residents in the county.
Rockland County Elections Commissioner Patricia Giblin said the precinct 35 election results reflect the area’s longstanding trends. The Orthodox Jewish population ""has consistently and overwhelmingly supported Republican candidates in the past elections,"" she said.
The Board of Elections ""thoroughly reviewed the results and confirmed no irregularities, fraud or hacking,"" Giblin said.
New York State Board of Elections spokesperson Kathleen McGrath told PolitiFact that state voting machines aren’t capable of connecting to the internet and couldn’t be hacked, as the social media posts claim.
Each ballot cast has a paper trail and all ballots are kept secure in a bipartisan manner, McGrath said. County election boards conduct mandatory post-election audits to confirm the results before certification, she said.
Voters can choose straight-ticket voting or choosing candidates for different parties, so ""claiming results of one race should be reflective of another race on the ballot are ill-founded,"" McGrath said.
Social media posts claim 2024 presidential election results in one Ramapo, New York, precinct — where Harris received zero votes — is proof that Musk hacked the vote count.
The precinct is in a heavily Orthodox Jewish area, where voters often vote as a bloc based on their rabbis’ endorsement. That’s likely what happened here, experts say, and previous elections showed similar patterns. Biden received zero votes in the precinct in 2020.
A New York elections official said the state’s voting machines aren’t connected to the internet and can’t be hacked.
We rate the claim False.

""Did we see 14,000 fired keystone pipeline workers fired on day one of the Biden admin paraded on 60 minutes?"" read an image shared byseveralpeopleon Facebook. ""Nope, so spare me your tears for the bureaucrats losing their jobs in DC right now.""
These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

On Jan. 20, 2021, Bidenrevoked a permitfor the Keystone XL oil and gas pipeline. The project would have extended the existing Keystone pipeline torun crude oilfrom Canada to Nebraska.
Construction was underway, with Reuters reporting that the pipeline was about8% built, when Biden’s order halted its progress.
Some peoplelost their jobs.
One day after Biden revoked the permit, TC Energy — the company behind the project — ""let go 1,000 workers in both the U.S. and Canada,""WorldOilreported.Reutersreported that TC Energy told employees by email that it would ""eliminate more than 1,000 construction jobs in coming weeks.""
That’s the clearest number of job cuts we could find immediately following Biden’s decision — 13,000 fewer than the Facebook posts’ claims.
We didn’t find a CBS News ""60 Minutes"" segment specifically about the jobs cut after Biden revoked the Keystone XL pipeline permit (the Facebook post alludes to the show). But anotherCBS News showand other outlets, includingReuters,VerifyandPolitiFactreported on the decision.
A2014 State Department reportfound that spending on the Keystone XL pipeline project construction ""would support approximately 42,100 jobs throughout the United States for the up to 2-year construction period.""
That doesn’t mean the pipeline construction would have created more than 42,000 new jobs, however. The reportspecifiedthat the term ""support"" encompassed newly created jobs and maintaining ""existing jobs in current or new locations.""
Pipeline spending would have supported3,900 total""direct, temporary construction"" jobs in states the pipeline ran through, the report said. And approximately 16,100 jobs would be ""direct jobs at firms that are awarded contracts for goods and services,"" including construction.
The report said that 29% — or about 12,000 of the 42,100 jobs over two years — would have been in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. It didn’t specify where other jobs would have been located.
The larger 42,100 total also included jobs supported by ""indirect"" and ""induced"" economic activity. Indirect economic activity refers to construction contractors’ purchases of goods and services,the reportsaid. Induced economic activity occurs when construction workers and the people who provide goods and services to those workers spend what they’ve earned. The reportlisted moneygoing to ""ranchers providing beef"" for construction workers as an example of induced economic activity.
Theeconomic analysis firmThe Perryman Group’s2010 pipeline economic impact analysisfor TransCanada (now TC Energy) estimated that the Keystone XL pipeline project would have createdabout 59,500 jobseach year of construction.
Two subsequentanalyses— one in 2011 byCornell University’s Global Labor Instituteand another in 2012 byRegional Economic Models, Inc.— criticized the Perryman report.
Those analyses said the report overestimated the Keystone XL pipeline’s U.S. financial impact by includingmoney spent outside the U.S.and reportinghigher-than-average job wages.
The Regional Economic Models, Inc., report estimatedabout 16,000to36,000Keystone XL pipeline construction jobs in the U.S. each year for two years.
The State Department’s 2014 reportpredictedthat when the pipeline extension was completed and operational, it would require about 50 employees in the U.S., including 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors.
""This small number would result in negligible impacts on population, housing, and public services in the proposed Project area,"" itsaid.
The 2011 Global Labor Institutereportsaid that ""based on the figures provided by TransCanada for the Canadian section of the pipeline,"" new permanent ""pipeline jobs in the US number as few as 50.""
Facebook posts said Biden ""fired"" 14,000 Keystone XL pipeline workers ""​​on day one"" of his administration.
On his first day in office, Biden revoked a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline’s construction. The next day, the company behind the project said it would eliminate about 1,000 jobs.
Various estimates said the project would create or support thousands of temporary jobs, and once completed, require about 50 U.S. employees.
There’s an element of truth — about 1,000 people lost their jobs — but we found no evidence that as many as 14,000 did.
We rate this claim Mostly False.

No US government audits for the last 100 years? Here’s why ‘Shark Tank’ star Kevin O’Leary is wrong,Louis Jacobson,"February 26, 2025","ABC’s ""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O’Leary said the federal government is ""all fat"" and said billionaire Elon Musk is ""not cutting enough.""
In a Feb. 24 interview on CNN, O’Leary, a Canadian investor who calls himself ""Mr. Wonderful,"" said this about thefederal government: ""One hundred years of never being scrutinized, never been examined, never looking for any efficiencies,"" he said. ""Finally, here's an individual who's willing to do it for free with extremely great executional skills.""
Since President Donald Trump tapped entrepreneur Elon Musk, he has been the public face of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla CEO, X owner and Trump campaign mega-donor went so far as to promote his cost-cutting efforts by wielding achainsawat a recent event.
When CNN host Laura Coates questioned the efficiency of what she called Musk’s ""thrash and burn"" approach, O’Leary said it isn’t possible to be surgically precise: ""You have to cut more because you just don't know. There's no way to do it. Remember, we've never audited government for 100 years.""
O’Leary is wrong. The federal government has conducted audits for decades, per federal law, and it has publicly shared the results. TheClinton-Gore administrationalso undertook a massive cost-cutting effort, but much of that followed congressional bipartisan approval.
""It is absurd to say that auditing has never happened,"" said Robin J. Kempf, an associate professor at University of Colorado, and a former inspector general for Kansas’ Medicaid program .
O’Leary did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.
In 1978, Congress passed theInspector General Actin response to anti-corruption efforts that began after the 1972 Watergate break-in and cover-up that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation. Agency inspectors general, fromNASAtoHomeland Security,were taskedwith conducting independent and objective audits, investigations and inspections and with preventing and detecting waste, fraud and abuse.
Their findings are not secret. Inspectors general provide semiannual reports to Congress and immediately report to agency heads if they find egregious problems.
The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency issued anannual reportfor 2023 that showed that work by inspectors general led to more than 4,000 prosecutions and identified nearly $93.1 billion in potential savings.
The findings resulted in about 3,000 suspensions, reprimands and terminations for federal contractors and federal, state and local employees.
Trump fired 17 inspectors general during his first week in office. (He said he wouldinstallnew ones.)
Separately, Congress in 1921 founded the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan, 3,000-employee investigative arm thatexaminesthe use of public funds, evaluates federal programs and policies, and undertakes other forms of federal oversight. (Until 2004 it was called the General Accounting Office.)
The office regularly produces reports on topics such as opioid addiction, affordable housing, and the federal response to COVID-19. On Feb. 25, the agencyreleasedits biennialHigh Risk List, which cited 38 areas of federal operations that have ""serious vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or in need of transformation.""
The agency says its efforts haveproducednearly $759 billion in cumulative savings, or an average of $40 billion per year, over the past 19 years.
Congress also carries outoversightthrough its committees. These include making sure that federal programs are fulfilling their missions and working in a cost-effective and efficient manner, and investigating waste, fraud, and abuse.
Here are a few audit findings in 2024:
COVID-19 recovery programs: The FBIwrotein January 2024 that the federal agencies found a combined $300 billion in fraud from pandemic recovery programs that  ""make the fraud the largest in history.""
Medicare, Medicaid, and other health and human services funds: The Department of Health and Human Services inspector generalsaidin December 2024 that it had found $7 billion in expected recoveries resulting from investigations and audits conducted in 2024 and 1,548 criminal and civil enforcement actions. The inspector generalpostsits recommendations online, where they are publicly accessible.
Costs for lead service line replacement: The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General issued areportin October identifying nearly $1 billion in questionable costs and funds for lead service line replacement in the states.
Audits are not only about money; some focus on how to improve federal agency’s missions. The inspector general audited theFBI’s counter terrorism programin the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Government auditing is highly structured and guided bystandardsfor auditing and performance assessments established by the Government Accountability Office, Kempf said.
""It is very focused on arriving at an independent assessment based on accuracy and a lack of bias,"" Kempf said. If Musk and DOGE are truly auditing, she said, ""we should be able to see the evidence that supports every conclusion and recommendation. There should be transparency.""
""None of that is happening with DOGE,"" she said.
DOGE has facedlawsuitsalleging a lack of transparency. Although MusksaidDOGE’s actions are ""maximally transparent,"" White House officials have resisted providing basic information for weeks, including disclosing who is DOGE’s administrator. A day after ajudgequestioned Justice Department attorneys about who is in charge, the White House told media outlets Feb. 25 that Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service. Gleason is a career official who has worked under presidents of both parties.
Ryan McDonough, an assistant accounting professor at Rutgers University, told PolitiFact that he doesn’t believe DOGE is ""claiming to conduct audits in accordance with government auditing standards.""
O’Leary in the CNN interview invoked a different model: the private equity playbook for cutting expenses by cutting ""deep"" and ""fast"" and then hiring back.
But this misses an important distinction: Unlike companies, which have a profit motive, the government isn’t a for-profit business. Although efficiency is important, its primary mission is to provide public services and deliver equal treatment to citizens.
""One can always learn from other institutional arrangements, and private equity is good at cutting redundancy, focused on value creation,"" said Shivaram Rajgopal, an accounting and auditing professor at Columbia Business School.
Rajgopal said such a model has ""some value"" for government auditing, but ""moving fast and breaking things is not a great recipe for government, in my view.""
O’Leary said, ""we've never audited government for 100 years.""
For decades, inspectors general have audited the federal government, looking for waste, fraud and abuse. Their findings are public and accessible online.
O’Leary left people with the impression that the federal government hasn’t been audited for a century. That’s ridiculously wrong.

"Without evidence, social media posts claim fraud in EPA grant to Stacey Abrams-linked group",Caleb McCullough,"February 26, 2025","Stacey Abrams, the two-time Democratic candidate for Georgia governor, did not steal $2 billion from a clean energy grant program, despite social media claims.
""Stacey Abrams stole $2 BILLION from taxpayers,"" one Feb. 19Facebook postsaid.
Other social media posts circulated a similar claim, including the conservative X account Libs of TikTok, whichaccusedthe funding of being a ""scam.""
The Facebook post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The claim stems from a $2 billion Environmental Protection Agencygrantthat went to Power Forward Communities, a coalition of clean energy groups, including one in which Abrams previously was a senior counsel. The grant, which the EPAawardedunder then-President Joe Biden, will fund energy efficient housing projects around the country. There’s no evidence Abrams directly received any of the grant money or engaged in illegal behavior.
Power Forward Communities consists of Rewiring America, Enterprise Community Partners, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, United Way, and Habitat for Humanity International. The groupformed in 2023to apply for the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy funding.
Abrams, an attorney, joinedRewiring America, one of the coalition’s members, in March 2023 as a senior counsel. Abrams did not have a role at Power Forward Communities beyond her position at Rewiring America, her spokesperson Joshua Karp said. She left Rewiring America at the end of 2024.
In October 2023, shortly after Rewiring America announced Power Forward Communities’ creation, Abrams said in anX postshe was ""Thrilled to be part of (Rewiring America) and the Power Forward Communities coalition.""
Power Forward Communities and Rewiring America declined to comment on the record. Power Forward Communities CEO Tim Mayopoulostold PoliticoAbrams was not paid by Power Forward Communities.
""Stacey Abrams has not received a penny of this EPA grant,"" Mayopoulos said in the Feb. 24 Politico article. ""It was never the plan for her to receive any money from this grant. Power Forward Communities has no relationship with Ms. Abrams, other than the fact that she’s one of the people who have advised one of our coalition members in the past.""
The $2 billion grant to Power Forward Communities was part of $20 billion in funding the EPA announced in April 2024. The funding came from the National Clean Investment Fund, part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created under the Inflation Reduction Actpassedin 2022 by congressional Democrats.
An April 4, 2024,releaseabout Power Forward Communities’ award said the coalition’s members would draw on their experience ""to build and lead a national financing program providing customized and affordable solutions for single-family and multi-family housing owners and developers.""
Power Forward Communities was one of three groups chosen for awards under the National Clean Investment Fund after a competitive review process, the EPA said at the time, that included reviews from dozens of federal employees and scoring of applications by expert review panels. The EPAadvertised the planfor the program that funded Power Forward Communities in 2023, indicating it intended to choose two or three national nonprofits to partner with local organizations to deliver the funding. The grant opportunity opened inJuly 2023, and it received five applications,E&E Newsreported.
President Donald Trump’s EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin hascriticized the processthat Biden’s EPA used to fund the projects, saying in a recent video that it was ""purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight."" The EPA under Trump is trying to claw back the funding that has been awarded. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.
Power Forward Communitiesannounced Feb. 24it is beginning work on projects representing $539 million in EPA grant funds. They include energy efficiency upgrades in Clinton, Iowa, a new apartment complex in Detroit, Michigan, and home renovations in Salem, Massachusetts.
A Facebook post said Stacey Abrams ""stole $2 BILLION from taxpayers.""
There’s no evidence for that.
Abrams was senior counsel to one of the five member organizations of a clean energy coalition that received $2 billion in funding from Biden’s EPA. Abrams was not paid by Power Forward Communities and did not receive any of the federal funds, its CEO said.

"Did Republicans propose increasing bank fees, as Buttigieg said? There’s more to the story",Caleb McCullough,"February 26, 2025","Pete Buttigieg, who served as transportation secretary during former President Joe Biden’s administration and is mulling a Senate run in Michigan, criticized proposed legislation to overturn a Biden-era banking regulation.
""I am not making this up: Republicans have introduced legislation… to increase your bank fees,"" Buttigieg said in a Feb. 18X post.
Buttigieg pointed to jointresolutionsproposed by Rep. French Hill of Arkansas and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, both Republicans, who chair their chambers’ banking committees. The resolution, which collectively has 25 other Republican co-sponsors, would overturn a recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that wouldcap overdraft chargesfrom large banks and credit unions at $5 unless banks offered the service as a regulated loan.
Overdraft protectionis a service many banks offer to cover purchases that cost more than an account’s balance. Customers are generally charged an overdraft fee in addition to paying back the original purchase price.
If the rule goes into effect on Oct. 1 as it's scheduled to, overdraft fees would be capped at lower levels than what some banks typically charge now. Conversely, if the Republican legislation passes, overdraft fees at some banks would not decrease as they would have if the regulation took effect. The Republican resolution would keep the status quo and not increase current overdraft fees.
Banking groups and the resolution’s supporters have called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule an overreach that will hurt competition and limit options for consumers, including people who don’t have access to other credit lines. TheConsumer Bankers Associationhas said its members would likely restrict the amount of overdraft services provided if a cap were enacted.
A Buttigieg spokesperson declined to comment on the record.
The rule limiting overdraft fees was issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog agency thatprotects consumersfrom unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted the agency for cuts, and the administration said it will continue to operate in astreamlined fashion.
The rule would require banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets that offer overdraft protection to choose one of the following actions:
Cap overdraft fees at $5 per transaction.
Set an overdraft fee that’s equal to the cost of offering the service.
Continue offering higher overdraft fees as a regulated loan, giving customers the choice to open a line of credit and providing disclosures on the loan’s terms.
Overdraft fees had beentrending downwardfor years, with fee revenue falling by about half since 2019, but fees began ticking up slightly in 2024. ABankrate surveyfound the 2024 average overdraft fee was about $27.08, slightly higher than 2023’s average of $26.61.Some banksdo not charge anything for overdraft protection, but 94% of accounts are at banks that charge overdraft fees, Bankrate said.
Banking groupssued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauin December over the overdraft protection rule, saying the agency overstepped its authority and the regulation would hurt consumers who don’t have access to other lines of credit. The rule’s critics said banks would have to raise fees elsewhere to make up for the lost income.
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit that has supported the rule, said overdraft fees are effectively high-interest loans without some of the reporting and repayment regulations loans are subject to.
""They are allowed to charge these high fees and engage in a whole bunch of manipulative practices to push people into overdrafting because they’re not complying with federal law that governs loans,"" Saunders said.
Banks mustdisclose their overdraftfees and policies according to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau policies, and customers mustopt into overdraft protection services. Butthe fees are exemptfrom some of the regulations governing other loans under theTruth In Lending Act.
Thelegislationis a tool Congress can use under the Congressional Review Act to overturn federal agency rulemaking. The joint resolution says Congress disapproves of the final rule and blocks the rule from taking effect. To become law, it requires approval by majorities in both chambers of Congress and the president’s signature.
If the resolution becomes law, banks could continue charging current fees or increase them if they choose.
If the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule takes effect, banks could lower their overdraft fees, offer higher fees with more regulations or no longer offer overdraft protection.
Saunders said repealing the regulation ""would increase bank fees from what they would be under the current regulation scheduled to go into effect.""
The Consumer Bankers Association, a trade organization, challenged Buttigieg’s framing of the legislation. In a statement, association spokesperson Weston Loyd said the claim that the resolution increases overdraft fees ""is plainly false and mentioned nowhere in the resolution.""
When we asked Hill, the House Financial Services Committee chair, for a response to Buttigieg’s claim, Hill’s spokesperson pointed us toHill’s interviewwith an Arkansas TV news station. Hill said in the interview he thinks consumers who overdraft their accounts out of necessity would be negatively affected by the rule. He said the rule could push some banks to stop offering overdraft protection or raise prices for other services.
""If I can’t charge a reasonable return for this service, for this convenience, then I won’t offer it. Or I’ll raise prices somewhere else,"" he said.
Other trade groups have alsoarguedthe Biden-era rule would push banks to raise fees elsewhere. In acommentsubmitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about the overdraft protection rule, America’s Credit Unions said that rule and others would incentivize credit unions to raise monthly checking and savings account fees and increase loan and credit card interest rates.
Regulations on fees would mean ""no more free checking accounts, more expensive loan products, and less staff available for that individual support that is critical for so many credit union members,"" America’s Credit Unions Chief Advocacy Officer Carrie Hunt said in the letter.
Saunders said higher monthly account fees are unlikely because competition among banks would keep account fees low.
Buttigieg said Republicans introduced legislation ""to increase your bank fees.""
The legislation would overturn a federal rule scheduled to go into effect Oct. 1 that would cap overdraft fees at $5 or require banks to offer overdraft protection as a regulated loan. The Republican resolution would not increase current overdraft fees.
The resolution is not widely applicable to banking fees; it applies to a single type of banking transaction that only applies to people who overdraw their bank accounts —about 25%of U.S. households.
The statement contains an element of truth because if the federal rule that Republicans are proposing to eliminate were to go into effect, overdraft fees would decrease at some banks. But it’s a stretch to say that overturning a rule that hasn’t been implemented represents a cost increase for consumers.

"Is it ‘official’ that Trump approved a $5,000 ‘DOGE dividend’ stimulus? No.",Sara Swann,"February 26, 2025","As billionaire Elon Musk aims to slash government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency, some social media users are claiming the money is on its way back to taxpayers.
A Feb. 23Facebook postread, ""Well it’s official, (President Donald) Trump to sign order from Elon Musk, giving taxpayers who have filed￼ their 2024 tax returns, a stimulus check for $5,000; not $1,200.""
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
An X usershareda similar post that read, ""It’s official! $5,000 DOGE Stimulus Checks confirmed by Trump!"" The post shared an edited image of a U.S. Treasury Department check for $5,000 with photos of Trump and Musk and text that read, ""DOGE checks approved.""
Although the idea of sending Americans $5,000 checks from the money DOGE saved has been floated, and Trump has mentioned it in speeches, Trump has not officially signed off on this. PolitiFact found no White House announcements or news reports about Trump signing off on this. We contacted the White House, but did not receive a response before publication.
Any plan to provide stimulus checks to Americans would need congressional approval, as was the case for the stimulus checks approved during the COVID-19 pandemic.
James Fishback, CEO and cofounder of investment firm Azoria Partners, which has held events at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, proposed the plan Feb. 14 on X and tagged Musk.
""American taxpayers deserve a ‘DOGE Dividend’: 20% (of) the money that DOGE saves should be sent back to hard-working Americans as a tax refund check,"" Fishbackwrote. ""At $2 trillion in DOGE savings and 78 million tax-paying households, this is a $5,000 refund per household, with the remaining used to pay down the national debt.""
However, it’s unclear whether DOGE will save enough money to make this proposal feasible.
DOGE’swebsitesaid Feb. 24 that its estimated savings total $55 billion, but thisdoesn’t add upaccording to the site’s ""wall of receipts,"" which supposedly tracks the cuts DOGE has made. The list of government contracts and real estate DOGE says it’s canceled amount to about $8.6 billion in savings. DOGE has not accounted for the remaining $46.4 billion.
The savings so far are a long way from DOGE’s initial goal of cutting $2 trillion from the federal government’s budget, which totaled $6.8 trillion last fiscal year. Musksaid in Januarythat $2 trillion was a ""best-case outcome,"" and there was a ""good shot"" at achieving $1 trillion in savings.
Fishback shared a longer version of his DOGE dividend plan in a Feb. 18X post. He proposed sending the tax refund checks after July 2026, when DOGE is set to expire.
Muskrepliedto Fishback’s post, saying he ""will check with the president.""
On Feb. 19, Trumptold reportersat the Saudi Arabia-backed Future Investment Initiative Institute’s Priority Summit in Miami that he was considering ""a new concept where we give 20% of the DOGE savings to American citizens and 20% goes to paying down debt.""
Later that day, when a reporter asked about the proposal on Air Force One, Trumpsaid, ""I love it. A 20% dividend, so to speak, for the money that we’re saving by going after the waste and fraud and abuse and all the other things that are happening. I think it’s a great idea.""
But it’s not ""official"" that Trump signed an order to give Americans $5,000 stimulus checks.
We rate this claim False.

Is Sen. Patty Murray right that Republican tax cuts are the biggest federal debt driver since 2001?,Louis Jacobson,"February 25, 2025","During a Senate floor debate over a budget resolution that could tee up President Donald Trump’s fiscal policies, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., warned her colleagues to proceed with caution before approving tax cuts for wealthier Americans.
The Republican budget resolution being debated, MurraysaidFeb. 20, is ""not about balancing the budget. We all know that. Because they don’t plan to reverse one of the biggest drivers of the debt: Republican tax cuts. Despite all the boogeymen the Republicans like to point to as driving the national debt, the reality is that the single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.""
REMINDER: The single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been **Republican** tax cuts.pic.twitter.com/zp2h9U7DGm
Murray is accurate when it comes to tax cuts and the federal debt, but she’s wrong to assert that Republicans acted alone.
A 2024analysisby the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally hawkish group, found that tax cuts were the biggest of four types of legislation that have added to the federal debt since 2001. Two other types of legislation trailed close behind tax cuts in fiscal impact: large stimulus bills and annual spending increases.
However, the tax cuts were enacted not only by Republicans; when the laws were extended, much of the debt they spurred was also ratified by congressional Democrats, President Barack Obama, or both. In fact, of five tax cut bills enacted since 2001, Murray ended up voting for two, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis examined legislation enacted since 2001 that had the biggest impacts on the federal government’s bottom line. The analysis did not factor in additional spending for mandatory programs such as Social Security because they were authorized before the 2001 cutoff.
The report broke down the new fiscal burdens into four broad categories:
The biggest category was tax cuts, at $8.4 trillion. These included revenue losses caused by the passage of major tax bills in2001,2003,2010,2013and2017.
Next was stimulus spending totaling $6.8 trillion, to counter the 2007-2009 Great Recession, and to ease the economic fallout beginning in 2020 from the coronavirus pandemic.
In third place was $5.9 trillion in new spending to keep the government running, enacted outside of major stimulus packages, typically through annual bills
The final piece was $1.1 trillion in Medicare expansion, notably the 2003 creation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit.
By this accounting, tax cuts accounted for a plurality, though not a majority, of the new debt created. The difference between first and second place was modest.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s analysis looked at whether the laws in question were passed by overwhelmingly partisan margins in Congress:
Republican President George W. Bush signed the2001 tax lawand it received near-unanimous Republican backing. But it also attracted a dozen Democratic votes in theSenateand 28 in theHouse.
Bush also signed the2003 tax law; this measure received only two Democratic votes in theSenateand seven in theHouse.
Democratic President Barack Obama signed the2010 tax lawafter its passage in theSenateby an 81-19 bipartisan margin and in theHouseby a 277-148 vote that included 139 Democratic and 138 Republican votes in favor.
Obama also signed the2013 tax law, after its passage in the Senate by unanimous consent, meaning no objections from any member of either party, and in theHousewith more Democrats voting in favor than Republicans.
Trump signed the2017 tax law. Democrats did not vote for the bill in either theHouseorSenate.
In other words, Bush’s 2003 tax law and Trump’s 2017 tax law were clearly Republican-backed bills without significant Democratic support, and Bush’s 2001 tax law was substantially, although not entirely, supported by Republicans.
But two of the five laws, in 2010 and 2013, were signed by Obama and supported by a broad swath of Democrats in both chambers.
The 2010 and 2013 laws related to extending tax laws that originated under Bush.
In a statement, Murray’s office told PolitiFact that the 2010 and 2013 laws were ""technically bipartisan"" but added that ""context is badly needed.""
""Democrats did not want to extend tax cuts for the wealthiest,"" Murray’s office said in a statement.
The negotiations for the 2010 tax bill occurred during the Great Recession, and the 2013 bill negotiations occurred before key expirations of laws, known as a ""fiscal cliff."" The looming expirations gave Republicans leverage to include higher-income taxpayers as beneficiaries of the legislation, against Democratic wishes.
Still, many congressional Democrats, and Obama, did move to extend tax laws that originated under Bush, effectively buying into their provisions. Murray ended up voting for both the 2010 and 2013 bills, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that in general, lawmakers expressed bipartisan support for the tax bills passed since 2001 and for the stimulus bills, the annual spending increases and the Medicare expansions.
The statement from Murray’s office said, ""Democrats strongly and emphatically opposed new tax cuts for the wealthy few — the bipartisan extension of those cuts was only accomplished as a part of tough negotiations with Republicans who in 2010 held tax cuts for middle-class families hostage during an economic crisis, and in 2012 leveraged a fiscal cliff to force the extension of these tax cuts. They are tax cuts initiated and passed by Republicans—they were also tax cuts protected by Republicans during bipartisan negotiations. The Republicans, not Democrats, own the tax cuts.""
Murray said, ""The single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.""
A 2024 Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis found that tax cuts were the biggest of four types of legislation that have added to the debt since 2001. Two other types of legislation trailed close behind in impact: large stimulus bills and annual spending increases.
However, the committee concluded that several of these tax cut bills also had Democratic buy-in from Congress or the president, or both, undercutting Murray’s assertion that Republicans acted unilaterally to pass the tax cuts. In fact, of five tax cut bills enacted since 2001, Murray ended up voting for two, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
We rate the statement Half True.

Claim that Chicago Cubs owner gave to Wis. Supreme Court hopeful Schimel is Mostly True,Madeline Heim,"February 25, 2025","Ask a Wisconsinite to name something that gets their blood boiling, and it’s a safe bet the answer will be about politics or the sports teams to our south.
A recent X post raises the question: What about both?
First, a little context: Wisconsin residentswill head to the polls April 1for the next in our seemingly endless cycle of consequential elections, casting a vote for either liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford or conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel to serve on the state Supreme Court.
The winner will determine whether the ideological tilt of the court will remain skewed liberal, which has been the casesince the election of Justice Janet Protasiewicz in 2023, or if it will return to a conservative majority, as it had been for 15 years prior. With such high stakes, experts believe the contest will produce a record-breaking level of spending, including from notable individuals and groups outside the campaigns themselves.
X user Kid Riles pointed outone such individual.
""To all the Milwaukee Brewers fans who live in Wisconsin: The Chicago Cubs owner is bankrolling Brad Schimel,"" the post reads. ""Vote accordingly.""
We periodically look at claims related to politics that are circulating on social media. So, is the owner of the Cubs really bankrolling Schimel’s campaign?
Let’s take a look.
We’ll get the baseball trivia out of the way first. The Ricketts family, headed by billionaire businessman Joe Ricketts,owns the Cubs. Joe’s son Tom is the team’schairman.
A look at Schimel’spublicly available campaign finance reportsdoes not show the Ricketts in his list of donors.
So what gives? The explanation requires some knowledge of campaign finance law in Wisconsin over the past decade.
The state’s campaign finance laws cap the amount that a person can give to a Supreme Court candidate to $20,000. But under a change the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislaturemade in 2015, political parties can receive unlimited donations, which they can funnel to their preferred candidates. (That change has ultimatelybenefited Democrats morebecause they have been able to raise more money.)
A review of the Republican Party of Wisconsin’s campaign finance reportsshows a Jan. 27, 2025 donation from Joe Rickettsof $500,000. After receiving this and other large donations from wealthy individuals, Republican party officialstransferred nearly $1.7 millionin three donations to Schimel’s campaign.
It’s illegalfor a donor to give to the party and say they expect it to flow to a certain candidate, meaning it’s impossible to definitively prove that Ricketts’ money was for Schimel.
Still, this practice has become a tried-and-true way for donors to get around individual contribution limits — so much so that Schimel encouraged people to do it.
At a Calumet County Republican Party event last July, Schimel urged those who could afford to give more than $20,000 to give to the state party instead,the Journal Sentinel previously reported, suggesting any money given after the Nov. 5, 2024 election would be transferred to him.
""If you want to give a lot more, you can give that to either of the state parties, and they can transfer it,"" he said. ""They can transfer that to candidates.""
(The Wisconsin Democracy Campaignfiled an ethics complaintin early February over this remark and others by Schimel, who is prohibited by law from personally soliciting campaign donations.)
The state Democratic Party has also made use of this playbook. In January, theyreceived$1 million from billionaire George Soros; $500,000 from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker; $490,000 from Milwaukee philanthropist Lynde Uihlein; $470,000 from retired software engineer Gloria Page, the mother of Google co-founder Larry Page; and $250,000 from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Weeks after receiving those donations, theytransferred $2 million in three donationsto Crawford’s campaign.
Now, for the nitty-gritty: the X post claims Ricketts is ""bankrolling"" Schimel. The dictionary definition of bankroll is ""to supply money for,"" but it’s worth noting that Ricketts is not supplying the majority of the funds in this extraordinarily expensive race.
ABC Supply owner Diane Hendricks gave $970,000 to the state Republican party in January, and Uline president Liz Uihlein gave $650,000. Even groups backed by Elon Muskhave dropped a few millionon TV ads and increasing voter turnout for Schimel.
All told, spending on this election is expected to outpace spending on Wisconsin’s last Supreme Court election in 2023, whichtotaled more than $56 millionandshattered national spending records.
A post on social media claimed Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts is bankrolling Schimel.
A review of campaign finance records shows Ricketts gave a large sum to the state GOP, which has alongside Democrats transferred money to preferred candidates in a well-known workaround of individual contribution limits — something Schimel has acknowledged outright.
Thus, the claim is largely accurate, though it’s missing the context of that workaround, which means we can’t know with complete certainty that Ricketts intended the money for Schimel.
Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
That fits here.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/25/social-media/claim-that-chicago-cubs-owner-gave-to-wis-supreme/

""The Philadelphia Eagles have declined their invitation to the White House,"" a Feb. 23Instagram postsaid. The post went on: ""Discussions between Eagles players and their front office resulted in a ‘massive no’ when asked if they would accept an invite to the White House to meet President Donald Trump.""

The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
But it appears those who engaged in social media chatter for and against the Eagles and a White House invitation spoke too soon. As of Feb. 24, a White House invitation had yet to be sent to the team.
A White House official told PolitiFact in an email that the Eagles did not reject an invitation, pointing us toan X postfrom conservative commentator Clay Travis, who said the White House had not yet sent an invitation.
Kelly backtracked ina replyto her X post after hearing of the White House’s denial, writing, ""Could be (hopefully?) fake news!""
The Eagles didn’t immediately return a request for comment. There is no statement on the team’ssocialmediaaccountsorwebsiteabout accepting or rejecting a White House invite, and we did not find examples of team spokespeople addressing the possibility in news coverage.
The claims stem from anarticledated Feb. 9, the day of the Super Bowl, in the U.S. Sun, the digital U.S. edition of the British tabloid newspaper. A story labeled, ""SUPER SNUB"" said that discussions before the game between players and the front office ""resulted in a ‘massive no’ when asked if they would accept an invitation to the nation’s capital.""
Eagles player Lane Johnson, the team’s captain and offensive right tackle,told the website SporticoFeb. 10 that a decision to visit the White House would be ""a team decision.""
It’s possible the Eagles may turn down a White House invite, if and when it’s offered, as the team and Trump, whopredicteda Chiefs victory in the Super Bowl, have a history.
In 2018, Trump said hecanceleda visit by the Eagles after their Super Bowl win over the New England Patriots,writing on Xthat ""only a small number of players decided to come."" He said it was related to Eagles players kneeling during the national anthem.
ESPNreportedin 2018 that team owner Jeffrey Lurie, former head coach Doug Pederson and a handful of Eagles players were planning to attend. Most of the team’s Black players planned to skip the visit, ESPN said, quoting unnamed sources.
It’s possible the team had reached an internal decision on how to respond to a Trump White House invite, but the team has not publicly shared that. And the White House said an invitation hasn’t been sent.
We will continue to monitor the situation. But so far, claims that the Eagles declined a White House invitation seem premature. We rate them False.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/24/social-media/did-philadelphia-eagles-decline-trump-white-house/
"No, DOGE didn’t drop cash from a helicopter; video uses two older, unrelated clips",Jeff Cercone,"February 24, 2025","Is Elon Musk dropping dollars from a helicopter onto California residents?
Some social media videos would have you believe that Musk, who’s leading President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, is using savings from federal government cuts and giving it back to Americans in a most unusual way.

But there has been no official word that Trump’s administration will return money saved by DOGE back to taxpayers, much less in a game-show like fashion from a helicopter.
And upon a closer look, the video is an edited version of two videos taken before DOGE was even a gleam in Trump’s or Musk’s eyes.
(Screenshot from Facebook)
Trump floated a proposalto give a dividend of 20% from DOGE savings — or $5,000 if it reaches its target of $2 trillion in savings — to taxpayers. How much taxpayer money DOGE is saving is not clear. PolitiFactreportedFeb. 21 that DOGE’s website touted $55 billion in savings, but its ""wall of receipts"" total about $8.6 billion. So far, no money has been returned to taxpayers.
We also wondered why the first batch of millions would go to California. Trump and Musk have publiclyfeudedwith California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom after deadly wildfires there last month.

The second was from November 2021, when ahighway crashin Carlsbad, California, involving an armored truck resulted in some drivers excitedly scooping up scattered cash on the road.

Delta Air Lines owns Endeavor Air, which operated Flight 4819 that crashed in Toronto. According to a Delta Air statement, the flight’s crew was not all female.
In a Feb. 20statementabout the flight, Delta Air Lines used ""he"" pronouns when describing the captain and ""she"" pronouns while describing the first officer. As of Feb. 21, the airline has not identified any of the crew members by name.
The images in the Instagram post came from Endeavor Airlines’s social media — a 2022TikTok postcelebrating Women’s History Month and the airline’s 2022X postwith an all-women crew that said, ""Buckle up, ladies and gentlemen, your flight is unmanned today. #girlpower."" Although the airline has promoted its female employees, these posts are not proof that Flight 4819’s crew had no men. Other Endeavor AirTikTokandXposts have included images of men in flight crews.

"No, this old news footage doesn’t prove former President Barack Obama wasn’t U.S.-born",Ciara O'Rourke,"February 21, 2025","Almost a decade after Joe Arpaio, then sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, hosted a news conference to further and falsely cast doubt on former President Barack Obama’s citizenship, some social media posts are reframing the event as new news.
""Wow! About time!"" a Feb. 19 Facebookpostsaid. ""The media is showing how Obama’s birth certificate was changed! He was never born in the U.S. so was never a real president! Everything he signed will be reversed!""
The post included news footage of the press conference.
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
First: Obama is a U.S. citizen who was born in the United States. But that hasn’t stopped people from baselessly claiming he was born in Kenya. Over more than a decade, PolitiFact hasfact-checked 30-some statementsabout Obama’s birthplace.
Arpaio is among those who have made such false claims. In 2016, he summoned journalists to a press conference to talk about Obama’s ""fake, fake birth certificate."" Mike Zullo, a member of Arpaio’s ""Cold Case Posse,"" ""explained how a careful analysis of the document’s typed letters and words, as well as the angles of the date stamps, proved forgery,"" the Arizona Republicreportedat the time.
""According to the theory,"" the Republic said, ""the birth certificate presented to the public was created after copying and pasting information from the legitimate birth certificate of a woman born in Hawaii.""
But that’s wrong.
After the Obama campaign released a copy of his ""Certification of Birth"" from Hawaii, posting the documentonlinein June 2008, FactCheck.org reporters went to the campaign’s headquarters to hold the document and examine it closely. They concluded that it was legitimate.
A few months later, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, then director of the Hawaii Department of Health, issued a statement saying that he and the registrar of vital statistics ""who has the statutory authority to oversee and maintain these types of vital records"" had personally seen and verified that the health department had Obama’s original birth certificate on record.
Janice Okubo, a health department spokesperson, told PolitiFact that birth certificates evolve over the decades, and there are no doubt differences between what Obama’s looked like when he was born and the documents issued today.
And if there was a plot to forge a birth certificate so that Obama could run for office, it went back decades — to the month he was born in 1961.
Will Hoover, who wrote a 2008 story for the Honolulu Advertiser about Obama’s childhood in Hawaii, told PolitiFact that he reviewed microfilm archives and found two birth announcements for Obama. One was in theHonolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13, 1961, and the other was in theHonolulu Star-Bulletin the next day. They both said the same thing: ""Mr. and Mrs. Barack H. Obama, 6085 Kalanianaole Highway, son, Aug. 4."" They were both submitted to the newspaper by the health department — not Obama’s family.
""Take a second and think about that,"" PolitiFact reported in 2009. ""In order to phony those notices up, it would have required the complicity of the state Health Department and two independent newspapers — on the off chance this unnamed child might want to one day be president of the United States.""

"No, Joe Biden did not have a 'voter importation' plan. Fact-checking Elon Musk's false CPAC claim.",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"February 21, 2025","When he wasn’t waving a bureaucracy chainsaw at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Elon Musk revived false campaign rhetoric about former President Joe Biden trying to import voters illegally.
In a Feb. 20 interview, Newsmax host Rob Schmitt asked, ""You think they were creating a new voter class? You think that was the goal when they opened up the borders for four years?""
Musk said Biden had a political incentive to ""maximize"" people in the country illegally.
""That is why the Biden administration was pushing to get in as many illegals as possible and spend every dollar possible to get as many, because every one of them is a customer,""Musk said. ""Everyone's a voter. The whole thing was a giant voter importation scam.""
Musk, now involved with President Donald Trump’s commission to cut government spending,repeatedfalsehoodshe spread early in the 2024 election year that Biden had an election strategy to import voters through illegal immigration. We emailed the White House press office asking for evidence and did not hear back.
There were historically high levels of illegal immigration during the Biden administration, but there is no evidence that Biden ""imported"" those people to become voters. Factors such as natural disasters and economic or political turmoil in a persons’ home country lead people to migrate.
Additionally, Musk’s statement ignored that the Biden administration removed and deported immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and it stepped up efforts in 2024 as he ran for reelection. (He dropped out in July.)
The Biden administration removed, returned or expelled more than 4.5 million people from February 2021, Biden’s first full month in office, to November 2024, the latest month with availabledata.
Illegal immigrationhas generallydroppedsince March 2024, and it dropped significantly after June, when Biden implementeda policylimiting people’s ability to apply for asylum at the southwest border. For example, there were more than 137,000 southwest borderencountersin March 2024 and 47,000 in December.
""Biden was trying to deport as many border crossers as he could, so I don’t see any evidence he wanted these people in the United States,"" said David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""He campaigned as being anti-illegal immigration. He never courted their votes, and he could not court their votes because they cannot vote and do not vote. Saying ‘every one of them was a voter’ is as divorced from reality as anything you could possibly say.""
Federal law requires U.S. citizenship to vote in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form that attests under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote.
The citizenship process takes several years.
""It takes on average five years in green card status before a person can become a U.S. citizen, so no one would instantly gain the right to vote,"" Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, previously toldPolitiFact.
Musk acknowledged at CPAC that it might take years for immigrants to gain citizenship, but it would be ""an investment that is guaranteed to pay off.""
Immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting. The Biden administrationfailedin its efforts to pass a law with a pathway to citizenship, and no such legislation is expected during the Trump administration.
There isno guaranteethat immigrants who become citizens will vote, or vote for Democrats. Although the southwest border gets the most attention, immigrants who come illegally arenot from Latin America only.
Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist in California and author of the book ""The Latino Century,"" said Republicans won the largest national Hispanic vote share in 2024 than in presidential elections in recent cycles.
Immigrants, including Hispanics, view the Republican Party as focused on economic issues and the Democratic Party as focused on cultural issues, Madrid said.
The New York Timesdocumented a conservative shift among immigrants after the 2020 election. Its analysis of voting in 28,000 precincts in more than 20 cities found that immigrant-dense neighborhoods with large populations of Latinos and residents of Asian descent had a surge in turnout and shifted to the right.
""There is zero evidence that immigration has harmed Republican Party prospects,""Bier previously told us.
Eligible naturalized citizens comprise about 10% of voters,Pew Research Centerfound in 2024.
There areincidentsof noncitizens voting in elections, but they are sporadic among millions of votes cast in federal elections. Immigrants who cross the border illegally are typically looking for jobs and many are escaping poverty or crime — most don’t want to risk drawing government authorities’ attention by casting a ballot.
Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation if they are here illegally or incarceration. Fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens often results from misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license.
Musk said Biden’s immigration policy was ""a giant voter importation scam.""
There is no evidence that the Biden administration was bringing in people illegally to cast votes. Government data shows more than 4.5 million removals, returns and expulsions during Biden’s tenure. Biden stepped up these actions during the election year.
It takes several years for immigrants to become citizens and therefore eligible to vote. Immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally cannot vote and would have to overcome hurdles to become citizens.
We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

El Congresista Adriano Espaillat no promovió una nueva bandera para la República Dominicana,Maria Briceño,"Febrero 21, 2025","¿Es cierto que el congresista de Nueva York, Adriano Espaillat, promovió una nueva bandera para la República Dominicana, tal como dice un video en Facebook? No, esa bandera no es nueva y profesores de historia dicen que por mucho tiempo ha sido asociada con un movimiento que independizó a la República Dominicana de Haití en 1844.
La publicación del 17 de febrero muestra al congresista sacando de su chaqueta una bandera con una cruz blanca, una franja roja y azul y con estrellas a los lados.
""De último minuto…miren lo ahí, la nueva bandera que están promoviendo para República Dominicana que se va a llamar DominicoHaiti"",diceel narrador en el video. ""Miralo ahi y la carga un dominicano, miralo ahi, Adriano Espaillat"".
La publicación fue marcada como parte del esfuerzo de Meta para combatir las noticias falsas y la desinformación en su plataforma. (Lea más sobrenuestra colaboración con Meta, propietaria de Facebook, Instagram y Threads).
Algunas personas en los comentarios del video en Facebook dijeron que no iban a permitir que se cambiara la bandera de su país, pero no hay evidencia de que esto vaya a suceder.
Al hacer una búsqueda en la base de noticias Nexis, no encontramos ninguna fuente verídica que dijera que se va a cambiar la bandera de República Dominicana. Tampoco encontramos ningúncomunicadoen la página de la presidencia de República Dominicana que hablara de un cambio. La página web de la presidencia siguemostrandola bandera actual como la oficial del país.
PolitiFact encontró unvideoen Instagram de Espaillat junto al periodista Adalberto Dominguez donde el congresista dice, ""Esta es la bandera original que diseñó Juan Pablo Duarte en República Dominicana"".
Duarte fundó el movimiento La Trinitaria el 16 de julio de 1838, liderando la lucha por la independencia de República Dominicana de Haití.
El presidente del Instituto Duartiano en la República Dominicana, una institución que difunde la historia de Duarte ledijoa Listín Diario, un periodico dominicano, que la bandera que Espaillat sostuvo no es de La Trinitaria.
""Bueno no hay duda, la diferencia entre la bandera haitiana, verdad y esa que presentaron es una leve cruz que aparece y unas estrellas, pero en esencia esa es más la bandera haitiana"", dijo el Dr. Wilson Gómez Ramírez, presidente del instituto, el 19 de febrero.
PolitiFact envió correos electrónicos y llamó a las oficinas de Espaillat, pero no recibimos respuesta.
Espaillat, nació en la República Dominicana y llegó a Estados Unidos cuando tenía 10 años con su familia. Él es el primer congresista de ascendencia dominicana en servir en el Congreso de Estados Unidos.
Espaillat organizó el séptimo evento consecutivo anual,Dominicans on the Hill(Dominicanos en el Capitolio), el 11 de febrero. Este evento conmemoró la cultura dominicana, sus logros como diáspora en EEUU y dialogó sobre cómo resolver los problemas que están afectando a sus comunidades.
La Dra. Mónica Espaillat Lizardo, profesora asistente de historia en la Universidad Estatal de Arizona, le dijo a PolitiFact que la bandera que sostenía Espaillat es una bandera que por mucho tiempo ha sido asociada con La Trinitaria.
""Creo que lo que más importa aquí es que, irónicamente, la bandera que exhibió Espaillat es en realidad una bandera histórica asociada con el objetivo de separación entre Occidente y Oriente: los países de Haití y lo que se convertiría en la República Dominicana"", dijo Espaillat Lizardo.
Ella añadió que la bandera de La Trinitaria, así como la primera bandera izada en el este para anunciar el establecimiento de la nación dominicana en febrero de 1844, se inspiraron en la bandera haitiana.
""La bandera es la bandera trinitaria, la bandera del movimiento político que se unió para crear la República Dominicana"", también nos dijo la Dra. Saudi García, directora deIn Cultured Company, una organización comprometida a crear igualdad entre dominicanos y haitianos.
Espaillat Lizardo le dijo a PolitiFact que no hay evidencia histórica disponible que definitivamente apoya que la bandera que sostuvo Espaillat fue la bandera de La Trinitaria o que Duarte diseñó esa bandera.
Pero tampoco es ""una nueva bandera creada ‘fusionista’ como se ha dicho en los medios"", Espaillat Lizardo dijo.
Ella añadió que ""Ningún documento histórico de puño y letra de Duarte confirma que fue el autor y diseñó la bandera Trinitaria o la primera bandera de la República Dominicana"".
La bandera actual de la República Dominicanaondeópor primera vez el 27 de febrero de 1844, día de la Independencia Nacional y se adoptó como símbolo de la patria el 6 de noviembre de 1844.
Desde el siglo XV, la isla La Española fuecolonizadapor España en su parte oriental y la parte occidental estuvo bajo dominio francés. En 1804, la parte occidental, ahora Haití, se independizó, y el resto de la isla siguió gobernada por España hasta 1821. Haití ocupó el territorio oriental el 9 de febrero de 1822, por 22 años.
En 1844, la sociedad secreta, La Trinitaria, liderada por Duarte, independizó a la República Dominicana de Haití.
Eventualmente, Haití se convirtió en el país más pobre de América, haciendo que miles de haitianos buscaran estabilidad política y económica en su país vecino. Estollevóa más tensión entre los países y género políticas migratorias contra los haitianos.
Una publicación en Facebook dice que Espaillat muestra ""La nueva bandera que están promoviendo para Republicana Dominicana que se va a llamar ""DominicoHaiti"".
Espaillat no mostró una nueva bandera para la República Dominicana.
Expertos en historia le dijeron a PolitiFact que él sostenía una bandera que por mucho tiempo ha sido asociada con La Trinitaria, la sociedad secreta separatista que independizó a República Dominicana de Haití. Los expertos dicen que no se sabe conclusivamente quien creó la bandera o si en realidad pertenece al movimiento separatista.
Pero lo que sí se sabe es que no es una nueva bandera que busca unir a Haití y la República Dominicana.
Ya que Espaillat no mostró una nueva bandera para la República Dominicana, calificamos esta publicación como Falsa.

Does a ‘US Debt Clock’ prove DOGE has saved $64 billion? Why the clock and that claim lack evidence,Sara Swann,"February 21, 2025","Shortly into President Donald Trump’s second term, some social media users claimed the Department of Government Efficiency, a new advisory committee tasked with slashing government expenses, had already reported massive savings.
A Feb. 7Instagram postshowed photos of Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, whom Trump tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Text above the photos read, ""According to the US Debt Clock, DOGE has saved taxpayers $64 billion dollars in just 17 days.""
Some social mediauserssharedthe same figure, whileothersclaimedthe savings since Trump took office were even higher, reaching more than $100 billion.

(Screenshot from Instagram)
These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
There’s no evidence the Department of Government Efficiency has saved the U.S. government $64 billion or more. In fact, DOGE’s website reports a much lower number, not all of which is accounted for.
The social media posts pointed to the website, ""USDebtClock.org,"" which claims to track the U.S. national debt and other economic and government data. The website wasregisteredin November 2008 by a company that keeps registrants’ names private.Internet Archiveshows the page has existed since at least December 2008.
Among the website’s many colorful boxes of rapidly increasing numbers is a golden box labeled ""D.O.G.E. Clock."" The Internet Archiveshowsthis supposed government savings tracker was added to the website Jan. 20, the day Trump took office.
On Feb. 21, one month into Trump’s second term, the DOGE Clock showed a total of $121 billion saved and counting. But the U.S. Debt Clock website doesn’t explain how it arrived at this number or who is maintaining the site — and its figures don’t align with what DOGE itself has described.
The debt clock site’sabout pagesays it is not associated with any U.S. government agency and not affiliated with or funded by any political party, organization or lobbying group. USDebtClock.org says it’s also not affiliated with thephysical National Debt Clocklocated in New York City or any other online debt clocks.
PolitiFact contacted the email listed on the website’s about page, but received no response before publication.
The U.S. Debt Clock also has mobile apps in theAppleandGoogle Playapp stores that were created by Chrono Numeric Labs LLC, a limited liability company registered in Michigan.
The debt clock website includes sources for all its metrics, except its DOGE Clock. When viewers hover over the DOGE Clock box, text appears that reads, ""The Department of Government Efficiency Advisory Commission, the real-time savings objective from reducing government waste, fraud and abuse in federal government agencies.""
The Department of Government Efficiency’s websitesaidFeb. 17 that its estimated savings from the government is $55 billion — less than half the total listed on the U.S. Debt Clock website.
But this $55 billion total doesn’t add up, according to the ""wall of receipts"" posted on DOGE’s website.
Initially, DOGE’s Feb. 17 data release listed 1,128 government contracts it says have been canceled for a total savings of $16 billion. However, one Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract wasincorrectlyvaluedat $8 billion instead of $8 million. After this error was fixed, the website’s receipts showed about $8.5 billion in savings.
As of Feb. 21, the site also listed about 100 real estate contracts, which, if terminated, DOGE says would save about $144.6 million.
DOGE has not yet accounted for the remaining $46.4 billion in savings it claims to have secured. The website says the contracts listed so far account for 20% of the overall savings, but that’s incorrect. The $8.6 billion in supposed savings accounts for about 15.7% of $55 billion.
AnNPR analysisfound that about half of the government contracts listed on DOGE’s website, accounting for $6.5 billion in supposed savings, haven’t been terminated. The contracts NPR confirmed as canceled accounted for $2 billion.
When we were looking into this post’s claim, we found multiple websites claiming to track the taxpayer money DOGE aims to save. The websites, ""dogegov.com"" and ""doge-tracker.com"" both feature a ""DOGE Live Tracker."" Neither website is affiliated with the federal government or DOGE.
The website dogegov.com wasregisteredSept. 1, 2024, and doge-tracker.com wasregisteredFeb. 3.
On Feb. 21, both websites said that the ""official"" amount of tax dollars saved was $55 billion, pointing to DOGE’s website as the source. According to DOGE’sX account, the online trackers said $51.7 billion had been saved.
Social media posts cited what they called the ""US Debt Clock"" and said, ""DOGE has saved taxpayers $64 billion dollars in just 17 days.""
There is no evidence to support this claim. The posts pointed to USDebtClock.org, but the website provided no source or explanation for its ""DOGE Clock"" counter with a rapidly increasing multibillion-dollar savings total, which had hit $121 billion by Feb. 21.
The Department of Government Efficiency’s website said that as of Feb. 17, the advisory committee has saved $55 billion. However, the data available on its site accounts for only $8.5 billion.
We rate this claim False.

Had the video stopped there, all would be well. We found a real Feb. 3Instagram videoof Leavitt shared from the White House account in which she said the same words.

In the real video, Leavitt boasted about Trump’s actions on border security, energy and the economy.
The Facebook video, however, shows stock footage of an unspecified street protest and of Trump, while a voice that sounds like Leavitt reads a different script.
Starting with a grammatically challenged intro, the narrator said, ""With ICE and DOGE have begun their process, the government has found extra funds for all Americans.""
It said everyone can apply at no cost and the $4,800 subsidy can be used with no restrictions and doesn’t need to be repaid. It said applicants must answer three questions and then they’ll receive the subsidy and a ""500 benefit card"" in a few days.
The Facebook post’s caption says ""Learn More,"" but there is no active link to click. The Facebook account, ""American Help,"" which is not affiliated with the federal government, lists a website that went to a dead link on Feb. 21.
Congress hasn’t passed, nor has Trump announced, a $4,800 subsidy to Americans, a search of Google, the Nexis news database and the White Housewebsiteshows.

Wepreviously fact-checkeda similar fabricated story taken out of context that claimed ""7th Circuit Court Judge Joseph Barron ruled that there is no provision to pardon someone who hasn’t been formally charged"" and that Biden’s pardons were unconstitutional.
That’s wrong, and so is this new claim about the ninth circuit and the volume of Biden’s final pardons.
There’s no Judge Joseph Barron onthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, nor onany U.S. Courts for the Ninth Circuit.
Biden issued 80 pardons over his four years as president,according to the Pew Research Center.
We also found no evidence, such as news reports or court filings, that any real judge ruled on the constitutionality of Biden’s pardons.

Rep. Nancy Mace is wrong. Not all people are born with either XX or XY chromosomes.,Grace Abels,"February 21, 2025","We often hear the expression that there are two kinds of people in this world.
But that doesn’t always apply when it comes to categorizing people by their sex chromosomes.
""You either have XX or XY chromosomes,"" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., wrote Feb. 20on X. ""Those are the options.""
Most commonly, a person is born with two X chromosomes (female) or an X and a Y (male). But this is not always the case.
Mace’s claim ignores the existence of several medical conditions, some first observed by scientists as far back as the 1930s.Genetic testingin the1950senabled scientists to link these conditions to various chromosomal abnormalities in which people’s sex chromosomes are neither XX nor XY.
Mace’s office did not respond to a request for comment before publication. After publication, her office wrote in a Feb. 21 email, ""Barring chromosomal abnormalities, a person with a typical number of chromosomes — known as a euploid — has either XX or XY which determines biological sex.""
About1.7% of the worldwide populationhas intersex conditions or differences in sex development — cases in which someone’s anatomy does not fit into male or female — according to a commonly cited review ofmedical literaturepublished in 2000 by Brown University biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling.
The conditions include:
Klinefelter Syndrome(XXY): People with this condition,first identified in 1942, have an extra X chromosome. People with this syndrome are typically assigned male at birth; the condition can result in infertility, low testosterone and undescended testicles. It occurs in about 1 in 600 males.
Turner Syndrome(missing or partial X):First identified in 1938, this syndrome occurs when a female is missing part of the X chromosome pair. This can cause short stature, delayed puberty, low sex hormones and possible infertility.
Triple X Syndrome(XXX): The symptoms of this syndrome, also called trisomy X, can vary from mild — tall height — to more severe, including developmental delays. The condition, present in about 1 in 1,000 females, wasfirst identified in 1959.
Jacob’s Syndrome(XYY): A relatively rare condition with mild symptoms, males with this syndrome are born with an extra Y chromosome. It occurs in about1 in 1000 malesand was identified in the 1960s.
According to afactsheetreleased by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, chromosomal variations ""occur in an estimated 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 2,000 live births, which amounts to approximately 200,000 to 330,000 Americans based on the current population.""
There are also intersex conditions that do not involve chromosomes because a person’s ""sex,""accordingtoscientists, is noteasilymeasuredbyone factor. Chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitalia can all contribute to a person’s sex categorization.
People born withde la Chapelle syndromehave XX chromosomes but can develop a penis, because a gene typically found on the Y chromosome gets moved to a new position on the X chromosome.
People withandrogen insensitivity syndromehave male chromosomes, but don’t respond to their body’s naturally produced male hormones, ranging from mild to complete insensitivity. In cases of complete insensitivity, genetically male fetuses (XY), with internal testes and normal testosterone production could develop vaginas and be assigned female at birth. Partial and mild insensitivity can result in more ambiguous sex characteristics.
Other conditionsalso result in ambiguous genitalia that do not fall neatly into a male or female sex category.
""A lot of other variations might be noticeable at birth if they cause other types of genital differences,"" Sylvan Fraser Anthony, legal and policy director at Interact, a nonprofit advocating for intersex youth,told PolitiFact. ""Others will be discovered, you know, not until later.""
Mace wrote on X, ""You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are the options.""Although most people are born with either XX or XY chromosomes, science dating back decades shows some people are born with other chromosomal variations.
We rate this claim False.
