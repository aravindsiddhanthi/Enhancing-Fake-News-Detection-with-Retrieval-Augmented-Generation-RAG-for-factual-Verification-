# Enhancing Fake News Detection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Fact Verification in U.S. Political News - Chatbot

This project builds a chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fact-check political news in the U.S. by leveraging a semantic retrieval engine and large language models (LLM) to ensure transparency and accuracy in news verification. The chatbot integrates Gemini Flash 1.5 LLM for context-aware generation and FAISS (Vector Database) for efficient vector-based document retrieval.
